# Analysis Scripts

This directory contains scripts and notebooks for analyzing experiments and bias measurements.

## Files Description

- **`analyze_result.py`**: The main script for processing raw experiment results. It calculates bias metrics and generates summary statistics.
- **`analyze_bias_cases.py`**: Deep Dive analysis into specific cases where bias was detected. Identifying patterns in how model outputs shift.
- **`analyze_summarization_after.py`**: Analyzes the quality and bias of summaries generated by the models.
- **`analyze_functions.py`**: Collection of utility functions used across different analysis scripts for data processing and metric calculation.
- **`analyze_result_final_v2.ipynb`**: Interactive Jupyter notebook for final data visualization and exploratory analysis used in the paper.

## Usage

To run the main result analysis:

```bash
python analyze/analyze_result.py
```
