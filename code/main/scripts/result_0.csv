kfSwBG201np7txpp,Wall Street Journal - News,Republicans are girding for a 2016 campaign debate with Democrats on immigration   but their presidential candidates are still unsure of the best way to handle an issue that could make or break their party ’ s ability to win back the White House . Many of the contenders are equivocating or openly shifting their positions on the central question of how to handle the millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally   which Hillary Clinton this week sought to make a defining issue . While Mrs. Clinton forcefully backed creating a pathway to citizenship for many illegal immigrants   the Republican field   by contrast   features a cacophony of voices . The jockeying underscores how immigration remains one of the biggest challenges facing Republicans in the 2016 presidential campaign   as they navigate the conflicting pressures of a primary contest   which entails wooing conservatives who generally oppose liberalizing immigration law   and those of the general election   where the GOP will be courting Hispanics who want a more open policy . Former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush once backed allowing a path to citizenship but has now stepped back and talks instead of offering legal status . Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was an architect of a broad immigration bill that included a citizenship path   but now favors a piecemeal approach . Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker has reversed himself on the issue—he now opposes a pathway to citizenship   which he once supported . Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is one of the toughest critics of offering citizenship to illegal immigrants but has left unanswered the question of whether they should eventually be allowed to earn legal status . Former Texas Gov . Rick Perry and former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee both say they want to tighten border security before taking other steps but are vague about what further policy would follow . “ What it looks like   I don ’ t know   ” Mr. Huckabee said . An Associated Press-GfK survey on immigration released May 6 asked half of respondents about a path to citizenship and found 53 % in favor . The other half were asked about a path to legal status   and 50 % expressed support . Among Republicans   only 4 in 10 support allowing immigrants who arrived as children   along with parents of citizens or permanent residents   to legally remain . Similarly   in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll late last year   57 % said they favored giving undocumented aliens already here a chance to become citizens   though there was a noticeable partisan split on the issue . Among Democrats   71 % favored a path to citizenship   while among Republicans support was just 40 % . The current stances of GOP candidates also tee up a campaign issue for Mrs. Clinton   who said while campaigning this week in Nevada that Republicans ’ refusal to embrace a pathway to citizenship would relegate millions of people to underclass status . “ People are working their way through these positions   ” said Andy Puzder   a Republican fundraiser who is chief executive of CKE Restaurants   the parent company of Carl ’ s Jr. and Hardee ’ s . He said the biggest risk for Republicans is that they “ use the immigration issue as a cudgel to beat each other up   and we get to the general and it kills us . ” Overhauling immigration law in a way that offers a chance at citizenship is an issue that matters to Hispanic voters across the board   said Javier Palomarez   president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce . “ Immigration is a unifying issue   ” he said . “ Any candidate who can not speak to that is going to have an uphill climb . ” Mr. Palomarez   whose group is talking to presidential candidates of both parties   said he was encouraged by signs that GOP candidates were backing away from some of the rhetoric Republicans have used in the past that many Hispanics saw as inflammatory   such as when Mitt Romney in 2012 called for illegal immigrants to “ self deport . ” “ They are evolving on this tricky issue   ” said Mr. Palomarez . “ They have come to the realization that without actively engaging this community they are never going to see the White House . ’ ’ In 2012   only 27 % of Hispanics voted for Mr. Romney   a steep decline from the 44 % who voted for the re-election of President George W. Bush in 2004 . The dynamic is far different within the Republican primary electorate than it is sure to be among general-election voters . For Jeb Bush   past support for a pathway to citizenship looms as a potential obstacle to winning the GOP nomination . Now he talks mostly about granting legal status short of citizenship and about overturning President Barack Obama ’ s executive actions . Mr. Rubio   who is Cuban-American   helped write the 2013 Senate bill that included a path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants   enhanced border security and other sweeping changes to the immigration system . Mr. Rubio backed away from the legislation after it died in the House . Now he emphasizes the importance of border security and says nothing can be done to put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship until Americans are convinced the border is secure . Mr. Walker earlier supported immigration legislation that offered a chance at citizenship to people here illegally . He has since renounced that position and argued that the jobs of U.S. citizens could be threatened by giving citizenship to illegal residents and even   potentially   by expanding legal immigration . Responding to Mrs. Clinton ’ s call for a pathway to citizenship   Mr. Walker said on Twitter that her “ full embrace of amnesty is unfair to hardworking Americans & immigrants who followed the law to achieve these rights . ” Sen. Rand Paul ( R.   Ky. ) a year ago seemed to be signaling openness to granting legal status to undocumented workers   but he ended up voting against the Senate immigration bill that included such provisions   saying it didn ’ t do enough to secure the border . Mr. Cruz opposes citizenship for illegal immigrants   but at a session last week with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce he deflected questions about whether he would support a pathway to legal status . Mr. Cruz said politicians should stay focused on advancing policies where there is consensus .,none,special,center,right

kfSwBG201np7txpp,Wall Street Journal - News,Republicans are girding for a 2016 campaign debate with Democrats on immigration   but their presidential candidates are still unsure of the best way to handle an issue that could make or break their party ’ s ability to win back the White House . Many of the contenders are equivocating or openly shifting their positions on the central question of how to handle the millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally   which Hillary Clinton this week sought to make a defining issue . While Mrs. Clinton forcefully backed creating a pathway to citizenship for many illegal immigrants   the Republican field   by contrast   features a cacophony of voices . The jockeying underscores how immigration remains one of the biggest challenges facing Republicans in the 2016 presidential campaign   as they navigate the conflicting pressures of a primary contest   which entails wooing conservatives who generally oppose liberalizing immigration law   and those of the general election   where the GOP will be courting Hispanics who want a more open policy . Former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush once backed allowing a path to citizenship but has now stepped back and talks instead of offering legal status . Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was an architect of a broad immigration bill that included a citizenship path   but now favors a piecemeal approach . Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker has reversed himself on the issue—he now opposes a pathway to citizenship   which he once supported . Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is one of the toughest critics of offering citizenship to illegal immigrants but has left unanswered the question of whether they should eventually be allowed to earn legal status . Former Texas Gov . Rick Perry and former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee both say they want to tighten border security before taking other steps but are vague about what further policy would follow . “ What it looks like   I don ’ t know   ” Mr. Huckabee said . An Associated Press-GfK survey on immigration released May 6 asked half of respondents about a path to citizenship and found 53 % in favor . The other half were asked about a path to legal status   and 50 % expressed support . Among Republicans   only 4 in 10 support allowing immigrants who arrived as children   along with parents of citizens or permanent residents   to legally remain . Similarly   in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll late last year   57 % said they favored giving undocumented aliens already here a chance to become citizens   though there was a noticeable partisan split on the issue . Among Democrats   71 % favored a path to citizenship   while among Republicans support was just 40 % . The current stances of GOP candidates also tee up a campaign issue for Mrs. Clinton   who said while campaigning this week in Nevada that Republicans ’ refusal to embrace a pathway to citizenship would relegate millions of people to underclass status . “ People are working their way through these positions   ” said Andy Puzder   a Republican fundraiser who is chief executive of CKE Restaurants   the parent company of Carl ’ s Jr. and Hardee ’ s . He said the biggest risk for Republicans is that they “ use the immigration issue as a cudgel to beat each other up   and we get to the general and it kills us . ” Overhauling immigration law in a way that offers a chance at citizenship is an issue that matters to Hispanic voters across the board   said Javier Palomarez   president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce . “ Immigration is a unifying issue   ” he said . “ Any candidate who can not speak to that is going to have an uphill climb . ” Mr. Palomarez   whose group is talking to presidential candidates of both parties   said he was encouraged by signs that GOP candidates were backing away from some of the rhetoric Republicans have used in the past that many Hispanics saw as inflammatory   such as when Mitt Romney in 2012 called for illegal immigrants to “ self deport . ” “ They are evolving on this tricky issue   ” said Mr. Palomarez . “ They have come to the realization that without actively engaging this community they are never going to see the White House . ’ ’ In 2012   only 27 % of Hispanics voted for Mr. Romney   a steep decline from the 44 % who voted for the re-election of President George W. Bush in 2004 . The dynamic is far different within the Republican primary electorate than it is sure to be among general-election voters . For Jeb Bush   past support for a pathway to citizenship looms as a potential obstacle to winning the GOP nomination . Now he talks mostly about granting legal status short of citizenship and about overturning President Barack Obama ’ s executive actions . Mr. Rubio   who is Cuban-American   helped write the 2013 Senate bill that included a path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants   enhanced border security and other sweeping changes to the immigration system . Mr. Rubio backed away from the legislation after it died in the House . Now he emphasizes the importance of border security and says nothing can be done to put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship until Americans are convinced the border is secure . Mr. Walker earlier supported immigration legislation that offered a chance at citizenship to people here illegally . He has since renounced that position and argued that the jobs of U.S. citizens could be threatened by giving citizenship to illegal residents and even   potentially   by expanding legal immigration . Responding to Mrs. Clinton ’ s call for a pathway to citizenship   Mr. Walker said on Twitter that her “ full embrace of amnesty is unfair to hardworking Americans & immigrants who followed the law to achieve these rights . ” Sen.

1sGNf6QnDQoZAlP5,Wall Street Journal - News,WASHINGTON—An American pastor held for two years in Turkey on terrorism charges arrived back in the U.S. on Saturday   greeting President Trump in the Oval Office and ending a diplomatic standoff that jeopardized relations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies . Andrew Brunson ’ s plane touched down at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington   D.C. around noon following a stop in Germany for what President Trump said was a medical evaluation . Safe on U.S. soil   Mr. Brunson headed to the White House where he and his family met with Mr. Trump   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a string of White House officials and lawmakers who had helped engineer his release . “ From a Turkish prison to the White House in 24 hours . That ’ s not bad   ” said Mr. Trump   with Mr. Brunson sitting next to him in the yellow chair normally reserved for visiting heads of state . Over the summer   Mr. Brunson was moved from jail to house arrest . In a moment that played out before TV cameras   Mr. Brunson knelt down   put his left arm around the president ’ s back and said a prayer   asking God to give Mr. Trump “ supernatural wisdom ” and to “ protect him from slander from enemies . ” Mr. Brunson ’ s homecoming amounted to a victory for Mr. Trump ahead of the midterm elections that will determine whether his party retains control of Congress . Evangelical Christians   an important part of Mr. Trump ’ s political base   closely followed his plight . Mr. Trump invested considerable strategic capital in freeing Mr. Brunson   using a mix of economic sanctions   public pressure and face-to-face talks with his Turkish counterpart . After the high-stakes diplomatic maneuvering   he risked looking ineffectual had Turkey kept Mr. Brunson locked up . Mr. Trump denied that he had cut any deals to win Mr. Brunson ’ s release   though he made clear he anticipates that relations between the two countries will improve now that the pastor is back home . Releasing Mr. Brunson was “ a tremendous step ” toward improved American-Turkish relations   Mr. Trump said . “ We ’ ve been negotiating long and hard   ” Mr. Trump said . “ We do not pay ransom in this country—at least any longer. ” He didn ’ t elaborate . Savoring the outcome   Mr. Trump suggested he has a better record than his Democratic predecessor   Barack Obama   in winning the release of Americans detained abroad . He invited Mr. Brunson ’ s wife and children to speak while also playfully pressing the family for an endorsement of sorts . “ Could I ask you one question ? Who did you vote for ? ” Mr. Trump said . “ I would like to say I sent in an absentee ballot from prison   ” Mr. Brunson said . “ It ’ s a little unfair ; I knew the answer   ” Mr. Trump said . Mr. Trump arrived triumphantly in Kentucky late Saturday for a campaign rally   mentioning Mr. Brunson ’ s safe return almost as soon as he took the stage . “ He is on American soil   ” he told a crowd of cheering supporters . “ It wasn ’ t easy . That one wasn ’ t easy . And we don ’ t pay ransom . ” Mr. Trump added that he believes the U.S. is now on track to have “ a terrific relationship with Turkey . ” The homecoming for Mr. Brunson   a North Carolina pastor affiliated with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church   unfolds in the shadow of the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi   the Saudi journalist who hasn ’ t been seen since he entered a Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 . Turkey has been looking for U.S. support in confronting Saudi Arabia over Mr. Khashoggi   who Turkish authorities allege was killed by Saudi operatives . Saudi Arabia has denied any involvement . From Turkey ’ s perspective   freeing Mr. Brunson could also give the country more leverage with the U.S. over Saudi Arabia.   U.S. officials said . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R.   S.C. )   a member of the Armed Services Committee   said in an interview : “ This was a real barrier to having a normal relationship with Turkey .

Mr. Trump took up the cause   using his Twitter feed and diplomatic tools to get Turkey to relent . In May   he met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House and urged him to quickly release Mr. Brunson   according to a White House readout of the meeting .

1sGNf6QnDQoZAlP5,Wall Street Journal - News,WASHINGTON—An American pastor held for two years in Turkey on terrorism charges arrived back in the U.S. on Saturday   greeting President Trump in the Oval Office and ending a diplomatic standoff that jeopardized relations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies . Andrew Brunson ’ s plane touched down at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington   D.C. around noon following a stop in Germany for what President Trump said was a medical evaluation . Safe on U.S. soil   Mr. Brunson headed to the White House where he and his family met with Mr. Trump   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a string of White House officials and lawmakers who had helped engineer his release . “ From a Turkish prison to the White House in 24 hours . That ’ s not bad   ” said Mr. Trump   with Mr. Brunson sitting next to him in the yellow chair normally reserved for visiting heads of state . Over the summer   Mr. Brunson was moved from jail to house arrest . In a moment that played out before TV cameras   Mr. Brunson knelt down   put his left arm around the president ’ s back and said a prayer   asking God to give Mr. Trump “ supernatural wisdom ” and to “ protect him from slander from enemies . ” Mr. Brunson ’ s homecoming amounted to a victory for Mr. Trump ahead of the midterm elections that will determine whether his party retains control of Congress . Evangelical Christians   an important part of Mr. Trump ’ s political base   closely followed his plight . Mr. Trump invested considerable strategic capital in freeing Mr. Brunson   using a mix of economic sanctions   public pressure and face-to-face talks with his Turkish counterpart . After the high-stakes diplomatic maneuvering   he risked looking ineffectual had Turkey kept Mr. Brunson locked up . Mr. Trump denied that he had cut any deals to win Mr. Brunson ’ s release   though he made clear he anticipates that relations between the two countries will improve now that the pastor is back home . Releasing Mr. Brunson was “ a tremendous step ” toward improved American-Turkish relations   Mr. Trump said . “ We ’ ve been negotiating long and hard   ” Mr. Trump said . “ We do not pay ransom in this country—at least any longer. ” He didn ’ t elaborate . Savoring the outcome   Mr. Trump suggested he has a better record than his Democratic predecessor   Barack Obama   in winning the release of Americans detained abroad . He invited Mr. Brunson ’ s wife and children to speak while also playfully pressing the family for an endorsement of sorts . “ Could I ask you one question ? Who did you vote for ? ” Mr. Trump said . “ I would like to say I sent in an absentee ballot from prison   ” Mr. Brunson said . “ It ’ s a little unfair ; I knew the answer   ” Mr. Trump said . Mr. Trump arrived triumphantly in Kentucky late Saturday for a campaign rally   mentioning Mr. Brunson ’ s safe return almost as soon as he took the stage . “ He is on American soil   ” he told a crowd of cheering supporters . “ It wasn ’ t easy . That one wasn ’ t easy . And we don ’ t pay ransom . ” Mr. Trump added that he believes the U.S. is now on track to have “ a terrific relationship with Turkey . ” The homecoming for Mr. Brunson   a North Carolina pastor affiliated with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church   unfolds in the shadow of the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi   the Saudi journalist who hasn ’ t been seen since he entered a Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 . Turkey has been looking for U.S. support in confronting Saudi Arabia over Mr. Khashoggi   who Turkish authorities allege was killed by Saudi operatives . Saudi Arabia has denied any involvement . From Turkey ’ s perspective   freeing Mr. Brunson could also give the country more leverage with the U.S. over Saudi Arabia.   U.S. officials said . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R.   S.C. )   a member of the Armed Services Committee   said in an interview : “ This was a real barrier to having a normal relationship with Turkey . This allows us to move forward . ” Mr. Brunson was arrested in October 2016 and charged with supporting terrorist groups . He denied the accusations . Mr. Trump took up the cause   using his Twitter feed and diplomatic tools to get Turkey to relent . In May   he met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House and urged him to quickly release Mr. Brunson   according to a White House readout of the meeting . In July   Mr. Trump tweeted : “ A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U.S. Pastor   Andrew Brunson   from prison . He has been held hostage far too long . ” The following month   the U.S. imposed sanctions on Turkish ministers . While Mr. Erdogan denounced the measures   he also privately looked for ways to settle the dispute   Turkish officials said .

1sGNf6QnDQoZAlP5,Wall Street Journal - News,WASHINGTON—An American pastor held for two years in Turkey on terrorism charges arrived back in the U.S. on Saturday   greeting President Trump in the Oval Office and ending a diplomatic standoff that jeopardized relations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies . Andrew Brunson ’ s plane touched down at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington   D.C. around noon following a stop in Germany for what President Trump said was a medical evaluation . Safe on U.S. soil   Mr. Brunson headed to the White House where he and his family met with Mr. Trump   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a string of White House officials and lawmakers who had helped engineer his release . “ From a Turkish prison to the White House in 24 hours . That ’ s not bad   ” said Mr. Trump   with Mr. Brunson sitting next to him in the yellow chair normally reserved for visiting heads of state . Over the summer   Mr. Brunson was moved from jail to house arrest . In a moment that played out before TV cameras   Mr. Brunson knelt down   put his left arm around the president ’ s back and said a prayer   asking God to give Mr. Trump “ supernatural wisdom ” and to “ protect him from slander from enemies . ” Mr. Brunson ’ s homecoming amounted to a victory for Mr. Trump ahead of the midterm elections that will determine whether his party retains control of Congress .

D0Nisj0XvTCeSrjl,NPR Online News,Fred Barnes is the executive editor of The Weekly Standard . Republican presidential candidate Matt Romney finishes his 8-day trip to the UK   Israel   and Poland with a speech in Warsaw today . It 's been an up-and-down trip as Romney seeks to demonstrate his ability to function effectively as an American leader overseas . The press has been judging Romney performance with an eye toward faulting him for gaffes and mishaps . And they 've spotted a few   though not as many as they 've claimed . Here 's The Weekly Standard scorecard of the trip   beginning with his final stop in Poland . Poland . In Gdansk   Romney got an unexpected boost from Lech Walesa   the Solidarity leader who led Poland to full independence from Russia   then served as president . Walesa said he wants Romney to be `` successful '' in defeating President Obama in the November election . This may not affect the Polish-American vote   but it ca n't hurt . Romney visited both the World War II memorial on the spot where the war began in 1939 and the Solidarity memorial near the shipyard where Walesa worked as an electrician . He and wife Ann held hands and were appropriately solemn at each memorial . He spoke at neither place . Israel . Romney was treated like a visiting head of state in Israel   not a mere candidate   by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres . Against the backdrop of the Old City of Jerusalem   he delivered a powerful speech in which he passionately supported Israel 's right to defend itself against the threat of a nuclear attack by Iran . He had promised not to criticize Obama while on foreign soil   but he still managed to make a case for embracing Israel that was far different from what Obama says on their subject . Without saying so directly   he told Israel : `` I am the alternative you are looking for . '' Indeed   he seems to be . The American press traveling with Romney labored to identify a gaffe . He spoke at a fundraiser at the King David Hotel and his audience was a roomful of rich guys like Sheldon Adelson . But instead of the fundraiser   it was a comment he made there that was labeled a `` misstep '' by the Washington Post . Romney noted that Israelis are more prosperous than Palestinians and he attributed that to differences in culture . He 'd said the same thing before   though not specifically about Israelis and Palestinians . Nonetheless   the Palestinians were furious and the White House zinged Romney   too . Israel score : a big-time positive for Romney London Olympics . Romney stepped into a haymaker here delivered by the British press . In an interview with NBC News   he said he was worried about whether the Olympics would go smoothly . Whoops . Criticizing Britain on British soil did n't go over at all . Romney got pounded   and when the British press was finished with him   American columnists took over . Romney should have known better . But   as it turned out   troubles have hit the Olympics : sparse crowds   ticket scalping by Olympics officials   and mix-ups that kept family members from seeing their kin in action . Romney was partially vindicated   though he got no credit . London Olympics score : negative . With a good speech today   Romney will complete his trip with a positive score   for what it 's worth .

Republican presidential candidate Matt Romney finishes his 8-day trip to the UK   Israel   and Poland with a speech in Warsaw today . It 's been an up-and-down trip as Romney seeks to demonstrate his ability to function effectively as an American leader overseas . The press has been judging Romney performance with an eye toward faulting him for gaffes and mishaps . And they 've spotted a few   though not as many as they 've claimed . Here 's The Weekly Standard scorecard of the trip   beginning with his final stop in Poland . Poland . In Gdansk   Romney got an unexpected boost from Lech Walesa   the Solidarity leader who led Poland to full independence from Russia   then served as president . Walesa said he wants Romney to be `` successful '' in defeating President Obama in the November election . This may not affect the Polish-American vote   but it ca n't hurt . Romney visited both the World War II memorial on the spot where the war began in 1939 and the Solidarity memorial near the shipyard where Walesa worked as an electrician . He and wife Ann held hands and were appropriately solemn at each memorial . He spoke at neither place . Israel .

dy1qiPxLlHWdk4yi,BBC News,Sudan 's rulers have agreed to hand over ex-President Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) to face genocide and war crimes charges . Bashir is accused of serious crimes in a conflict that broke out in Darfur in 2003 and led to the deaths of 300 000 . Authorities said the former president   and others charged by the ICC   should appear before the court . The commitment came at peace talks between Sudan 's government and rebel groups from the Darfur region . `` Justice can not be achieved if we do n't heal the wounds   '' said Mohammed Hassan al-Taishi   a spokesman for the Sudanese government . He told BBC Focus on Africa radio that Bashir and three others would be handed over to the ICC . Asked if supporters of the ousted president would accept this decision   Mr Taishi replied that no-one was above justice . `` We are doing what the Sudanese people asked us to do   '' he added . Mr Taishi stressed that he was expressing the view of the government   which includes powerful generals in the military   and not his personal view . Mr Taishi is a civilian member of Sudan 's sovereign council   the body overseeing the country 's transition to democracy . The Sudanese delegation negotiating with rebels in Darfur has made a key concession to victims of the Darfur conflict by agreeing that all those wanted by the ICC should be handed over to the court to stand trial . The surrender of former President Bashir is   in fact   something that Sudan 's top military general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan alluded to at a meeting in December with victims of the conflict . But there is no guarantee that it will happen - the generals may renege on the deal . If it does happen   it is unlikely to be anytime soon   as talks to end the conflict still have a long way to go and the transfer of the wanted men - from both sides of the conflict - would have to be part of a broader peace deal . Bashir   who refused to recognise the authority of the court when he was charged for crimes in the region in 2009   was ousted as president in April last year . On Tuesday   one of his lawyers told Reuters news agency that Bashir would continue to refuse to deal with the ICC   describing it as a `` political court '' . ICC prosecutors in The Hague requested that the former leader stand trial over the Darfur killings and issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of genocide   war crimes and crimes against humanity . The UN says that in addition to those killed in fighting between local armed groups   and Bashir 's forces and government-backed militia - such as the infamous Janjaweed - around 2.5 million people were displaced in the war . Warrants for Bashir 's arrest were issued in 2009 and 2010 by the ICC . The court investigates and brings to justice people suspected of genocide   crimes against humanity and war crimes   intervening when national authorities can not or will not prosecute . The ICC was established by a UN treaty in 2002   and has been ratified by 123 countries   including the UK . However   several countries - including China   India   Russia and the US - have refused to join   while some African countries say the court is unfairly focused on Africans . The international court has been criticised in the past for securing too few convictions   mishandling cases and over-reaching its jurisdiction . Bashir   76   came to power in a military coup in 1989 and ruled Sudan with an iron fist . In December   he was sentenced to two years in a social reform facility for corruption . Under Sudanese law   people over the age of 70 can not serve jail terms . Prosecutors in Sudan have also charged him with the killing of protesters during the demonstrations that led to him being ousted .,none,special,center,center

dy1qiPxLlHWdk4yi,BBC News,Sudan 's rulers have agreed to hand over ex-President Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) to face genocide and war crimes charges . Bashir is accused of serious crimes in a conflict that broke out in Darfur in 2003 and led to the deaths of 300 000 . Authorities said the former president   and others charged by the ICC   should appear before the court . The commitment came at peace talks between Sudan 's government and rebel groups from the Darfur region . `` Justice can not be achieved if we do n't heal the wounds   '' said Mohammed Hassan al-Taishi   a spokesman for the Sudanese government . He told BBC Focus on Africa radio that Bashir and three others would be handed over to the ICC . Asked if supporters of the ousted president would accept this decision   Mr Taishi replied that no-one was above justice . `` We are doing what the Sudanese people asked us to do   '' he added . Mr Taishi stressed that he was expressing the view of the government   which includes powerful generals in the military   and not his personal view . Mr Taishi is a civilian member of Sudan 's sovereign council   the body overseeing the country 's transition to democracy . The Sudanese delegation negotiating with rebels in Darfur has made a key concession to victims of the Darfur conflict by agreeing that all those wanted by the ICC should be handed over to the court to stand trial . The surrender of former President Bashir is   in fact   something that Sudan 's top military general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan alluded to at a meeting in December with victims of the conflict . But there is no guarantee that it will happen - the generals may renege on the deal . If it does happen   it is unlikely to be anytime soon   as talks to end the conflict still have a long way to go and the transfer of the wanted men - from both sides of the conflict - would have to be part of a broader peace deal . Bashir   who refused to recognise the authority of the court when he was charged for crimes in the region in 2009   was ousted as president in April last year . On Tuesday   one of his lawyers told Reuters news agency that Bashir would continue to refuse to deal with the ICC   describing it as a `` political court '' . ICC prosecutors in The Hague requested that the former leader stand trial over the Darfur killings and issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of genocide   war crimes and crimes against humanity . The UN says that in addition to those killed in fighting between local armed groups   and Bashir 's forces and government-backed militia - such as the infamous Janjaweed - around 2.5 million people were displaced in the war . Warrants for Bashir 's arrest were issued in 2009 and 2010 by the ICC . The court investigates and brings to justice people suspected of genocide   crimes against humanity and war crimes   intervening when national authorities can not or will not prosecute . The ICC was established by a UN treaty in 2002   and has been ratified by 123 countries   including the UK . However   several countries - including China   India   Russia and the US - have refused to join   while some African countries say the court is unfairly focused on Africans .

c6pjbMHpSMV7p77T,BBC News,US President Donald Trump has launched a fierce personal attack on former special counsel Robert Mueller   describing him as `` totally conflicted '' . He said the man who led the inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election had `` wanted to be the FBI director   and I said 'no ' '' . The president also claimed the two had had a `` business dispute '' . Mr Mueller reiterated on Wednesday that his inquiry did not exonerate Mr Trump of obstruction of justice . Following Mr Mueller 's comments - his first public statement on his inquiry - Democratic presidential candidates called for the Republican president to be impeached . But the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives is sceptical of such a move . And any attempt to remove the president from office would almost certainly be rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate . At the White House on Thursday morning   Mr Trump said impeachment was a `` dirty   filthy disgusting word '' . He said Mr Mueller was a `` true Never Trumper ''   referring to his Republican critics during the 2016 White House race   and that his investigation was `` a giant presidential harassment '' . Mr Trump also referred to the special counsel 's team of investigators as `` some of the worst human beings on Earth '' . He claimed Mr Mueller had approached him at the Oval Office in 2017 seeking to regain his former position as FBI director . The president said : `` Robert Mueller should never have been chosen because he wanted the FBI job and he did n't get it and the next day he was picked as special counsel . '' But according to the Mueller report   former White House strategist Stephen Bannon told investigators that the special counsel had not gone to the White House job-seeking . Mr Bannon said Mr Trump 's oft-repeated claims about Mr Mueller 's supposed conflicts of interest were `` ridiculous '' . On Thursday   the president also told reporters he had `` a business dispute '' with Mr Mueller . It was not clear what Mr Trump was referring to   but in 2011 Mr Mueller suspended his membership with a Trump-owned golf course in northern Virginia . Afterwards   Mr Mueller requested to have his annual dues refunded but never heard back from the Trump Organization   according to a Washington Post report from last year . In a tweet earlier on Thursday   Mr Trump seemed to say for the first time that Moscow had played a role in helping him to get elected   while disavowing his own involvement . `` Russia   Russia   Russia ! That 's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax ... And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected   '' he wrote . But on the White House lawn   he said : `` No   Russia did not help me get elected . You know who got me elected ? I got me elected . Russia did n't help me at all . '' Mr Mueller - who was FBI director under President George W Bush - made his first and only public comments over the two-year investigation in a statement to media on Wednesday . He said that charging a sitting president with a crime `` is not an option '' due to a long-standing US Department of Justice policy . `` If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime   we would have said so   '' Mr Mueller declared in a live broadcast   contradicting Mr Trump 's claims of exoneration . The special counsel 's 448-page report issued in April did not establish that Mr Trump conspired with Russia to sway the White House election   but listed 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice by the president . After a brief presidential ceasefire   hostilities against Robert Mueller have resumed . The president is clearly irked that Mr Mueller grabbed headlines yesterday when he reiterated the results of his investigation that were far from exoneration for the president . In the immediate aftermath of Mr Mueller 's report   the president had claimed complete vindication - and even agreed that the special counsel had acted honourably . The picture was n't as rosy once the report 's details were made public   however . And while Mr Mueller declined to determine whether the president had obstructed the investigation   his `` I ca n't say he 's not guilty '' conclusion was damning in its own way . Mr Mueller 's public statement put bullet points on those findings . So the president is going back on the attack   ensuring - if there were ever any doubt - that Mr Mueller   his report and subsequent action by Congress will continue to be mired in partisan warfare .,none,special,center,right

Mr Trump also referred to the special counsel 's team of investigators as `` some of the worst human beings on Earth '' . He claimed Mr Mueller had approached him at the Oval Office in 2017 seeking to regain his former position as FBI director . The president said : `` Robert Mueller should never have been chosen because he wanted the FBI job and he did n't get it and the next day he was picked as special counsel . '' But according to the Mueller report   former White House strategist Stephen Bannon told investigators that the special counsel had not gone to the White House job-seeking . Mr Bannon said Mr Trump 's oft-repeated claims about Mr Mueller 's supposed conflicts of interest were `` ridiculous '' . On Thursday   the president also told reporters he had `` a business dispute '' with Mr Mueller . It was not clear what Mr Trump was referring to   but in 2011 Mr Mueller suspended his membership with a Trump-owned golf course in northern Virginia . Afterwards   Mr Mueller requested to have his annual dues refunded but never heard back from the Trump Organization   according to a Washington Post report from last year . In a tweet earlier on Thursday   Mr Trump seemed to say for the first time that Moscow had played a role in helping him to get elected   while disavowing his own involvement . `` Russia   Russia   Russia ! That 's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax ... And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected   '' he wrote . But on the White House lawn   he said : `` No   Russia did not help me get elected . You know who got me elected ? I got me elected . Russia did n't help me at all . '' Mr Mueller - who was FBI director under President George W Bush - made his first and only public comments over the two-year investigation in a statement to media on Wednesday . He said that charging a sitting president with a crime `` is not an option '' due to a long-standing US Department of Justice policy . `` If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime   we would have said so   '' Mr Mueller declared in a live broadcast   contradicting Mr Trump 's claims of exoneration . The special counsel 's 448-page report issued in April did not establish that Mr Trump conspired with Russia to sway the White House election   but listed 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice by the president . After a brief presidential ceasefire   hostilities against Robert Mueller have resumed . The president is clearly irked that Mr Mueller grabbed headlines yesterday when he reiterated the results of his investigation that were far from exoneration for the president . In the immediate aftermath of Mr Mueller 's report   the president had claimed complete vindication - and even agreed that the special counsel had acted honourably . The picture was n't as rosy once the report 's details were made public   however . And while Mr Mueller declined to determine whether the president had obstructed the investigation   his `` I ca n't say he 's not guilty '' conclusion was damning in its own way .

ZcUVO18TcsvkHWc5,Christian Science Monitor,Gov . Rick Snyder ( R ) of Michigan put forward a new and controversial plan Thursday to award 50 000 visas over five years to immigrants willing to settle and work in Detroit as part of his efforts to revitalize the bankrupt city . The move would require a federal action to increase in the employment-based visas for immigrants   as well as a drastic change in the way that such visas are awarded . As a result   immigration experts are skeptical that Governor Snyder 's plan will become a reality . Yet some remain intrigued by the long-shot proposal 's potential to change the national conversation around immigration reform . Snyder is   after all   a Republican   which puts an unusual twist on the usual national debate about immigration . In recent years   much of the discussion – primarily among Republicans – has revolved around the societal costs of immigration and the strain that immigrants place on services and unemployment levels . But Snyder 's request highlights that immigrants can also be job creators   says Rick Su   a law professor at the State University of New York Buffalo Law School . Immigrants tend to be twice as likely to start a business as non-immigrants   the Partnership for a New American Economy found . In 2011   immigrants started more than a quarter of new businesses in the country . In 2007   Immigrants employed 4.7 million people and generated more than $ 776 billion in revenue   according to the Fiscal Policy Initiative . This idea that immigration can actually be beneficial for business and the economy has potential to bridge the sharp political divide that has so far dominated the current conversation   says Ann Lin   a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . “ This has a real chance to make both Republicans and Democrats think a little differently about the immigration issue . ” Snyder 's request may seem contrary to the stricter immigration laws advocated by many in his party . But the idea could appeal to advocates wishing to strengthen state rights . In order to gain any real momentum   Snyder will likely have look for allies outside Michigan and come up with a more comprehensive proposal   Professor Lin says . “ You want to think very carefully about what the preconditions of immigration are   ” Lin says . “ You don ’ t want to say   ‘ Lets bring in smart people and hope that some of them will create businesses . ’ ” Canada has allowed individual states and provinces to admit immigrants into their region since the 1990s .

Snyder is   after all   a Republican   which puts an unusual twist on the usual national debate about immigration . In recent years   much of the discussion – primarily among Republicans – has revolved around the societal costs of immigration and the strain that immigrants place on services and unemployment levels . But Snyder 's request highlights that immigrants can also be job creators   says Rick Su   a law professor at the State University of New York Buffalo Law School . Immigrants tend to be twice as likely to start a business as non-immigrants   the Partnership for a New American Economy found . In 2011   immigrants started more than a quarter of new businesses in the country . In 2007   Immigrants employed 4.7 million people and generated more than $ 776 billion in revenue   according to the Fiscal Policy Initiative . This idea that immigration can actually be beneficial for business and the economy has potential to bridge the sharp political divide that has so far dominated the current conversation   says Ann Lin   a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . “ This has a real chance to make both Republicans and Democrats think a little differently about the immigration issue . ” Snyder 's request may seem contrary to the stricter immigration laws advocated by many in his party . But the idea could appeal to advocates wishing to strengthen state rights . In order to gain any real momentum   Snyder will likely have look for allies outside Michigan and come up with a more comprehensive proposal   Professor Lin says . “ You want to think very carefully about what the preconditions of immigration are   ” Lin says . “ You don ’ t want to say   ‘ Lets bring in smart people and hope that some of them will create businesses . ’ ” Canada has allowed individual states and provinces to admit immigrants into their region since the 1990s .

ZcUVO18TcsvkHWc5,Christian Science Monitor,Gov . Rick Snyder ( R ) of Michigan put forward a new and controversial plan Thursday to award 50 000 visas over five years to immigrants willing to settle and work in Detroit as part of his efforts to revitalize the bankrupt city .

rgf6lwGUaSSUJ7m0,Voice of America,For many years   American colleges and universities have let people speak on their campuses even if many students do not agree with their beliefs . College-aged students often do not agree with conservative political beliefs . But school officials believe that letting speeches by conservatives and others take place on campus can help lead to free and open debate . But recent protests show that beliefs about free speech on college campuses may be changing . Since February   protests have broken out at colleges across the country -- including the University of California-Berkeley   Middlebury College   the Claremont Colleges   and California State University   Los Angeles . The protests started because conservative speakers were set to give talks about their beliefs . Some people have criticized the protesters for trying to prevent controversial speakers from being heard . Will Creely is the senior vice president of legal and public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) . He told VOA that those who support free speech are worried about the protests . He says schools should work harder to protect speakers who may have different political beliefs than many students . Last month   a student group at Middlebury College in Vermont invited Charles Murray to speak on the campus . Murray is a political scientist and a fellow with the conservative American Enterprise Institute . His research has linked race and intelligence . The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Murray a white nationalist . Hundreds of protesters shouted as Murray tried to speak . Officials moved him to another building   where he spoke with Professor Allison Stanger . His discussion with her was shown online . College spokesman Bill Burger says that as Stanger and Murray left the building   they were “ physically and violently confronted by a group of protesters ” who “ set upon [ their ] car   rocking it   pounding on it   jumping on and trying to prevent it from leaving campus . ” Stanger was taken to a hospital . She left wearing a neck brace . She said during the dispute with protesters   one of them grabbed her hair and pulled her backward . In a message on Facebook   Stanger wrote : “ I feared for my life . ” Earlier this month   students at Claremont McKenna College in California targeted Heather MacDonald . She is a researcher at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a well-known critic of the Black Lives Matter movement . Students said they disagreed with a book MacDonald published last year called The War on Cops . In it   MacDonald wrote that police officers are afraid to do their work because of increased attention from reporters following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson   Missouri in 2014 . Brown   who is black   was killed by a white officer . A student group invited MacDonald to speak on campus . But protesters stopped her from entering the building where she was to speak . She was forced to instead broadcast her speech on the internet . She did so from a room that was mostly empty ; protesters had blocked people from entering . The protesters hit the room ’ s windows and shouted until MacDonald later said   “ the cops decided that things were getting too chaotic and I should stop speaking . ” Police officers then had to help MacDonald leave the building so she could safely escape the protesters . After her speech   more than 20 students signed a letter to David Oxtoby   one of the school ’ s presidents . They called MacDonald a “ fascist . ” The letter demanded that the university “ take action ” against an independent student newspaper for its reporting on the protests and for its “ continual perpetuation of hate speech . ” Oxtoby had previously condemned the protests and defended MacDonald ’ s right to speak on campus . He said the college supports “ the exercise of free speech and academic freedom . ” The students said MacDonald is a well-known figure and her beliefs have been reported many times by the news media . They said refusing to let her speak did not violate her rights . And they said MacDonald being on campus is “ a form of violence . ” Creely says incidents like the ones at Middlebury and Claremont are becoming increasingly common at American colleges . He called the trend “ deeply troubling . ” Creely also criticized university officials for accepting the demands of students . He says the students do not know enough about laws that protect free speech in the United States . He notes that “ there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment . There is an unfortunately prevalent problem of students being unaware of the extent of their rights and the rights of their peers   ” he said . In 2015   the market research group YouGov asked students about free speech . In the opinion study   43 percent of the students questioned said “ making sure that students have an environment free from discrimination   even if that means placing some limits on what students can say   ” should be more of a concern for colleges than protecting the “ absolute right to free speech . ” Gallup did a similar study in 2016 . It found that 52 percent of students believe their college or university should stop people from speaking on campus who have a history of making hateful comments . Forty two percent of students did not agree with the statement   however . The debate about First Amendment rights continued earlier this month when the University of California-Berkeley canceled a planned speech by conservative writer and speaker Ann Coulter . University officials said they were worried that police would not be able to control a possibly violent reaction to Coulter ’ s speech . Riots took place at Berkeley earlier this year when conservative journalist Milo Yiannopoulos was invited to speak . The riots caused $ 100 000 in damage to buildings on campus . The school ’ s decision to cancel Coulter ’ s speech was criticized by many people . So officials changed their decision . They set a time for her to speak   but the time they set was one during which fewer people would be on campus . The student group that invited Coulter to speak did not like the plan . It sued the school on Monday   claiming it was discriminating against Coulter . Lawyer Harmeet Dhillon and the Berkeley College Republicans said in the lawsuit that “ this case arises from efforts by one of California ’ s leading public universities   UC Berkeley   once known as the ‘ birthplace of the Free Speech Movement   ’ to restrict and stifle the speech of conservative students whose voices fall beyond the campus political orthodoxy . ” The school said the charge that Coulter is being punished for her political beliefs is “ untrue . ” The school said it “ welcomes speakers of all political viewpoints and is committed to providing a forum to enable Ann Coulter to speak on the Berkeley campus . ” Joshua Fatzick wrote this story for VOANews.com Christopher Jones-Cruise adapted his report for Learning English .

rgf6lwGUaSSUJ7m0,Voice of America,For many years   American colleges and universities have let people speak on their campuses even if many students do not agree with their beliefs . College-aged students often do not agree with conservative political beliefs . But school officials believe that letting speeches by conservatives and others take place on campus can help lead to free and open debate . But recent protests show that beliefs about free speech on college campuses may be changing . Since February   protests have broken out at colleges across the country -- including the University of California-Berkeley   Middlebury College   the Claremont Colleges   and California State University   Los Angeles . The protests started because conservative speakers were set to give talks about their beliefs . Some people have criticized the protesters for trying to prevent controversial speakers from being heard . Will Creely is the senior vice president of legal and public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) . He told VOA that those who support free speech are worried about the protests . He says schools should work harder to protect speakers who may have different political beliefs than many students . Last month   a student group at Middlebury College in Vermont invited Charles Murray to speak on the campus . Murray is a political scientist and a fellow with the conservative American Enterprise Institute . His research has linked race and intelligence . The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Murray a white nationalist . Hundreds of protesters shouted as Murray tried to speak . Officials moved him to another building   where he spoke with Professor Allison Stanger . His discussion with her was shown online . College spokesman Bill Burger says that as Stanger and Murray left the building   they were “ physically and violently confronted by a group of protesters ” who “ set upon [ their ] car   rocking it   pounding on it   jumping on and trying to prevent it from leaving campus . ” Stanger was taken to a hospital . She left wearing a neck brace . She said during the dispute with protesters   one of them grabbed her hair and pulled her backward . In a message on Facebook   Stanger wrote : “ I feared for my life . ” Earlier this month   students at Claremont McKenna College in California targeted Heather MacDonald . She is a researcher at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a well-known critic of the Black Lives Matter movement . Students said they disagreed with a book MacDonald published last year called The War on Cops . In it   MacDonald wrote that police officers are afraid to do their work because of increased attention from reporters following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson   Missouri in 2014 . Brown   who is black   was killed by a white officer . A student group invited MacDonald to speak on campus . But protesters stopped her from entering the building where she was to speak . She was forced to instead broadcast her speech on the internet . She did so from a room that was mostly empty ; protesters had blocked people from entering . The protesters hit the room ’ s windows and shouted until MacDonald later said   “ the cops decided that things were getting too chaotic and I should stop speaking . ” Police officers then had to help MacDonald leave the building so she could safely escape the protesters . After her speech   more than 20 students signed a letter to David Oxtoby   one of the school ’ s presidents . They called MacDonald a “ fascist . ” The letter demanded that the university “ take action ” against an independent student newspaper for its reporting on the protests and for its “ continual perpetuation of hate speech . ” Oxtoby had previously condemned the protests and defended MacDonald ’ s right to speak on campus . He said the college supports “ the exercise of free speech and academic freedom . ” The students said MacDonald is a well-known figure and her beliefs have been reported many times by the news media . They said refusing to let her speak did not violate her rights . And they said MacDonald being on campus is “ a form of violence . ” Creely says incidents like the ones at Middlebury and Claremont are becoming increasingly common at American colleges . He called the trend “ deeply troubling . ” Creely also criticized university officials for accepting the demands of students . He says the students do not know enough about laws that protect free speech in the United States . He notes that “ there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment .

College spokesman Bill Burger says that as Stanger and Murray left the building   they were “ physically and violently confronted by a group of protesters ” who “ set upon [ their ] car   rocking it   pounding on it   jumping on and trying to prevent it from leaving campus . ” Stanger was taken to a hospital . She left wearing a neck brace . She said during the dispute with protesters   one of them grabbed her hair and pulled her backward . In a message on Facebook   Stanger wrote : “ I feared for my life . ” Earlier this month   students at Claremont McKenna College in California targeted Heather MacDonald . She is a researcher at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a well-known critic of the Black Lives Matter movement . Students said they disagreed with a book MacDonald published last year called The War on Cops . In it   MacDonald wrote that police officers are afraid to do their work because of increased attention from reporters following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson   Missouri in 2014 . Brown   who is black   was killed by a white officer . A student group invited MacDonald to speak on campus . But protesters stopped her from entering the building where she was to speak . She was forced to instead broadcast her speech on the internet . She did so from a room that was mostly empty ; protesters had blocked people from entering . The protesters hit the room ’ s windows and shouted until MacDonald later said   “ the cops decided that things were getting too chaotic and I should stop speaking . ” Police officers then had to help MacDonald leave the building so she could safely escape the protesters . After her speech   more than 20 students signed a letter to David Oxtoby   one of the school ’ s presidents . They called MacDonald a “ fascist . ” The letter demanded that the university “ take action ” against an independent student newspaper for its reporting on the protests and for its “ continual perpetuation of hate speech . ” Oxtoby had previously condemned the protests and defended MacDonald ’ s right to speak on campus . He said the college supports “ the exercise of free speech and academic freedom . ” The students said MacDonald is a well-known figure and her beliefs have been reported many times by the news media . They said refusing to let her speak did not violate her rights . And they said MacDonald being on campus is “ a form of violence . ” Creely says incidents like the ones at Middlebury and Claremont are becoming increasingly common at American colleges . He called the trend “ deeply troubling . ” Creely also criticized university officials for accepting the demands of students . He says the students do not know enough about laws that protect free speech in the United States . He notes that “ there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment . There is an unfortunately prevalent problem of students being unaware of the extent of their rights and the rights of their peers   ” he said . In 2015   the market research group YouGov asked students about free speech . In the opinion study   43 percent of the students questioned said “ making sure that students have an environment free from discrimination   even if that means placing some limits on what students can say   ” should be more of a concern for colleges than protecting the “ absolute right to free speech . ” Gallup did a similar study in 2016 . It found that 52 percent of students believe their college or university should stop people from speaking on campus who have a history of making hateful comments . Forty two percent of students did not agree with the statement   however . The debate about First Amendment rights continued earlier this month when the University of California-Berkeley canceled a planned speech by conservative writer and speaker Ann Coulter . University officials said they were worried that police would not be able to control a possibly violent reaction to Coulter ’ s speech . Riots took place at Berkeley earlier this year when conservative journalist Milo Yiannopoulos was invited to speak . The riots caused $ 100 000 in damage to buildings on campus . The school ’ s decision to cancel Coulter ’ s speech was criticized by many people . So officials changed their decision . They set a time for her to speak   but the time they set was one during which fewer people would be on campus . The student group that invited Coulter to speak did not like the plan . It sued the school on Monday   claiming it was discriminating against Coulter . Lawyer Harmeet Dhillon and the Berkeley College Republicans said in the lawsuit that “ this case arises from efforts by one of California ’ s leading public universities   UC Berkeley   once known as the ‘ birthplace of the Free Speech Movement   ’ to restrict and stifle the speech of conservative students whose voices fall beyond the campus political orthodoxy . ” The school said the charge that Coulter is being punished for her political beliefs is “ untrue . ” The school said it “ welcomes speakers of all political viewpoints and is committed to providing a forum to enable Ann Coulter to speak on the Berkeley campus . ” Joshua Fatzick wrote this story for VOANews.com Christopher Jones-Cruise adapted his report for Learning English .

rgf6lwGUaSSUJ7m0,Voice of America,For many years   American colleges and universities have let people speak on their campuses even if many students do not agree with their beliefs . College-aged students often do not agree with conservative political beliefs . But school officials believe that letting speeches by conservatives and others take place on campus can help lead to free and open debate . But recent protests show that beliefs about free speech on college campuses may be changing . Since February   protests have broken out at colleges across the country -- including the University of California-Berkeley   Middlebury College   the Claremont Colleges   and California State University   Los Angeles . The protests started because conservative speakers were set to give talks about their beliefs . Some people have criticized the protesters for trying to prevent controversial speakers from being heard . Will Creely is the senior vice president of legal and public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) . He told VOA that those who support free speech are worried about the protests . He says schools should work harder to protect speakers who may have different political beliefs than many students . Last month   a student group at Middlebury College in Vermont invited Charles Murray to speak on the campus . Murray is a political scientist and a fellow with the conservative American Enterprise Institute . His research has linked race and intelligence . The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Murray a white nationalist . Hundreds of protesters shouted as Murray tried to speak . Officials moved him to another building   where he spoke with Professor Allison Stanger . His discussion with her was shown online . College spokesman Bill Burger says that as Stanger and Murray left the building   they were “ physically and violently confronted by a group of protesters ” who “ set upon [ their ] car   rocking it   pounding on it   jumping on and trying to prevent it from leaving campus . ” Stanger was taken to a hospital .

ufTTfftL8JH1thBK,USA TODAY,ROME — A powerful earthquake toppled homes   churches and shops in a wide swath of medieval towns in central Italy Wednesday   killing at least 247 people and injuring hundreds of others   according to Italy 's civil protection agency . Dozens more were missing or feared dead from the magnitude-6.2 earthquake and a series of aftershocks that jolted Umbria   Lazio and Le Marche   three regions 80 to 100 miles northeast of Rome . Rescue teams using bulldozers   and aided by townspeople with their bare hands   were still poring through the piles of rock   metal and wood late Wednesday looking for possible survivors . Police near the town of Ascoli said they could hear cries for help from under the rubble but lacked the heavy equipment to move the rocks   according the RAI radio . “ We need chain saws   shears to cut iron bars   and jacks to remove beams : everything   we need everything   ” civil protection worker Andrea Gentili told the Associated Press . Italian Premier Matteo Renzi spoke Wednesday evening in the provincial capital of Rieti after flying over the Le Marche region and visiting first responders and survivors the picturesque town of Amatrice   one of the hardest hit . There was no immediate or exact breakdown of the death toll   but the Italian news agency ANSA earlier reported at least 35 dead in Amatrice   11 in Accumoli   near Rieti   and 17 in the province of Ascoli Piceno   which includes Pescara del Tronto . Renzi reported 35 dead in Le Marche . Fabrizio Curcio   director of Italy ’ s civil protection agency   activated national emergency procedures . He said the quake was on par with one in L'Aquilla in 2009 that left more than 300 people dead . Much of city center of Amatrice was covered with mounds of debris as structures tumbled in the initial quake and later aftershocks . Resident of the popular tourist destination of around 3 000 people gathered in the piazzas   dazed by the quake and fearful of more temblors . “ The whole ceiling fell but did not hit me   ” said resident Maria Gianni   according to the AP . “ I just managed to put a pillow on my head and I wasn ’ t hit luckily   just slightly injured my leg . ” The Vatican sent a six-man team from the Vatican City fire squad to Amatrice . A statement said the decision was taken as a “ sign of the pope ’ s concrete proximity to the people affected by the quake . '' Mayor Sergio Pirozzi of Amatrice told the AP that rescue teams were trying to reach all 69 hamlets around his town . “ Half of the town doesn ’ t exist anymore   ” he told RAI-TV . “ People are stuck underneath the rubble . Houses are no longer there . ” Amatrice is perhaps best known as the home of spaghetti all ’ amatriciana   a hearty dish of pasta made with bacon-like bits of cured pork jowl   pecorino cheese and tomato.The town was set to host its 50th spaghetti festival Saturday . The first quake struck around 3:30 a.m.   collapsing walls and ceilings of homes and trapping people as they slept . It was followed by at least 11 temblors in what the seismological center described as a “ high aftershock rate . ” Pirozzi said the quake also knocked out power to the community   hampering communications with emergency responders . The remote town was virtually cut off after a bridge connecting it to the rest of the region was damaged . The local hospital was also badly hit   forcing the wounded and stretcher-bearers to gather in front of the building . Ambulances then transferred patients to other towns . In Accumoli   Mayor Stefano Petrucci said at least 2 500 people were displaced   including 2 000 summer season tourists . `` We will try to assist them all   but you 'd better leave the country   '' he told them   according to ANSA . In Pescara and Arquata del Tronto   two tent cities were being erected to accommodate the displaced   ANSA reported . Civil defense teams were rounding up camp stoves and generators . Other homeless families were being sheltered in gyms and other public buildings . A geologist in Poland says that earthquake was caused by the slow but constant under-surface movement of the African Plate toward Europe . Jerzy Zaba of the Silesian University in Katowice   in southern Poland   said Wednesday that a wedge-shaped front of the African Plate is pressing into the Eurasian Plate in the Adriatic Sea region and pushes into the neighboring regions   like Italy ’ s Apennine Mountains . The tension that accumulates leads to a sudden release in the form of under-surface rock movement that causes earth tremors . Zaba told Polish PAP agency that the African Plate is moving northwards at the speed of up to 2 inches a year .

Police near the town of Ascoli said they could hear cries for help from under the rubble but lacked the heavy equipment to move the rocks   according the RAI radio . “ We need chain saws   shears to cut iron bars   and jacks to remove beams : everything   we need everything   ” civil protection worker Andrea Gentili told the Associated Press . Italian Premier Matteo Renzi spoke Wednesday evening in the provincial capital of Rieti after flying over the Le Marche region and visiting first responders and survivors the picturesque town of Amatrice   one of the hardest hit . There was no immediate or exact breakdown of the death toll   but the Italian news agency ANSA earlier reported at least 35 dead in Amatrice   11 in Accumoli   near Rieti   and 17 in the province of Ascoli Piceno   which includes Pescara del Tronto . Renzi reported 35 dead in Le Marche . Fabrizio Curcio   director of Italy ’ s civil protection agency   activated national emergency procedures . He said the quake was on par with one in L'Aquilla in 2009 that left more than 300 people dead . Much of city center of Amatrice was covered with mounds of debris as structures tumbled in the initial quake and later aftershocks . Resident of the popular tourist destination of around 3 000 people gathered in the piazzas   dazed by the quake and fearful of more temblors . “ The whole ceiling fell but did not hit me   ” said resident Maria Gianni   according to the AP . “ I just managed to put a pillow on my head and I wasn ’ t hit luckily   just slightly injured my leg . ” The Vatican sent a six-man team from the Vatican City fire squad to Amatrice . A statement said the decision was taken as a “ sign of the pope ’ s concrete proximity to the people affected by the quake . '' Mayor Sergio Pirozzi of Amatrice told the AP that rescue teams were trying to reach all 69 hamlets around his town . “ Half of the town doesn ’ t exist anymore   ” he told RAI-TV . “ People are stuck underneath the rubble . Houses are no longer there . ” Amatrice is perhaps best known as the home of spaghetti all ’ amatriciana   a hearty dish of pasta made with bacon-like bits of cured pork jowl   pecorino cheese and tomato.The town was set to host its 50th spaghetti festival Saturday . The first quake struck around 3:30 a.m.   collapsing walls and ceilings of homes and trapping people as they slept . It was followed by at least 11 temblors in what the seismological center described as a “ high aftershock rate . ” Pirozzi said the quake also knocked out power to the community   hampering communications with emergency responders . The remote town was virtually cut off after a bridge connecting it to the rest of the region was damaged . The local hospital was also badly hit   forcing the wounded and stretcher-bearers to gather in front of the building . Ambulances then transferred patients to other towns . In Accumoli   Mayor Stefano Petrucci said at least 2 500 people were displaced   including 2 000 summer season tourists . `` We will try to assist them all   but you 'd better leave the country   '' he told them   according to ANSA . In Pescara and Arquata del Tronto   two tent cities were being erected to accommodate the displaced   ANSA reported . Civil defense teams were rounding up camp stoves and generators .

9SAdod48kIQFMzQS,Christian Science Monitor,The idea of a team of rivals serving the president best by offering an array of passionately held and clashing views for the chief executive to ponder has been around since at least Abraham Lincoln . And for the last 17 months of Donald Trump ’ s presidency   the White House has depicted the president as relishing the strong and often conflicting positions within his national security team – and above all between Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and the famously self-assertive and acerbic national security adviser   John Bolton . That portrayal took a hit Tuesday when Mr. Trump abruptly announced through a tweet that he was firing Mr. Bolton   with whom he said he had often “ strongly disagreed. ” Mr. Bolton said he had resigned . The president went on to hint at the widely known reality that Mr. Bolton had increasingly found himself the White House odd man out – both in personality and in viewpoint on issues from Iran to North Korea and Afghanistan . “ I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions   ” Mr. Trump tweeted   “ as did others in the Administration . ” Whether it was by firing or resignation   Mr. Bolton ’ s departure had seemed inevitable for a while . Yet what spelled the doom of Mr. Trump ’ s third national security adviser in less than three years was not so much his strong views on key foreign-policy issues   former officials and national security analysts say . Rather   it was his take-charge approach to issues   among them Iran and Venezuela   that annoyed a president who may appreciate hearing different viewpoints but does not like being pushed in directions his gut tells him he doesn ’ t want to go . Moreover   the president does not tolerate any suggestion   particularly to the press or the public generally   that anyone but him is in charge . “ Trump likes a multiplicity of advisers presenting a variety of approaches   but he is very averse to situations where his advisers are ganging up on him and leading him to a certain line of thinking – that he does not like   ” says Peter Feaver   a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University in Durham   North Carolina . “ It ’ s one thing if the president hasn ’ t decided what to do   but it ’ s quite another if the president has decided to go left   and his adviser is there saying   ‘ No no no   you ’ ve got to go right . ’ ” Indeed Professor Feaver   who directed national security strategy planning during President George W. Bush ’ s second term   says it was some of Mr. Bolton ’ s same qualities that originally drew Mr. Trump ’ s interest – above all his frequent smart   attack-dog commentaries on foreign policy   usually on Fox News – that ended up souring the relationship between the two . “ At the very same time [ in 2017 ] that the president ’ s advisers were advising him to stay in the JCPOA   ” the six-nation nuclear agreement with Iran   “ there was John Bolton on TV saying very effectively and compellingly to the president ’ s ears that what the president wanted to do – which was to get out of the JCPOA – was the right thing to do   ” Professor Feaver says . But before long it would be precisely that public assertiveness that would begin irritating Mr. Trump . In particular   he was put off by Mr. Bolton ’ s early interaction with the press that suggested he was running the Iran and Venezuela policies . When Mr. Bolton ’ s entourage suggested over the weekend to some media contacts that it was Mr. Bolton who had prevailed in squelching a surprise Camp David meeting with the Taliban to sign a peace deal ending the U.S. war in Afghanistan   it was seen by some as the last straw . And that despite the president having indeed agreed with his national security adviser by nixing the high-profile meeting . Andrew Harnik/AP/File From left   national security adviser John Bolton   Secretary of State Mike Pompeo   and President Donald Trump   in the Oval Office   Feb. 7   2019 . Former officials and analysts say Mr. Bolton ’ s take-charge approach to issues annoyed the president . By this spring   relations between the president and his national security adviser had chilled considerably   as Mr. Bolton seemed increasingly dissonant with the president ’ s preference for big deals and showy diplomacy   such as his three unprecedented meetings with North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Un . Indeed   at the same time in late June that Mr. Trump was crossing the border between the two Koreas to meet Mr. Kim for the third time   Mr. Bolton was in Mongolia – dispatched there by a president who wanted an adviser who had called for regime change in North Korea nowhere in sight . And then there was Iran . Mr. Trump was fine with Mr. Pompeo ’ s “ maximum pressure ” campaign largely reliant on increasingly tough sanctions to get Tehran to the negotiating table . But he was less comfortable with Mr. Bolton ’ s push for a more belligerent approach to the Iranian regime . When Mr. Trump at the last minute called off a military strike on Iran in retaliation for the shoot-down in June of a U.S. drone   some White House and State Department officials quipped privately that Mr. Bolton had brought the president to within 10 minutes of a war he didn ’ t want . “ I temper John   which is pretty amazing   ” Mr. Trump mused last spring . For some analysts with close contacts with the Trump White House   Mr. Bolton ’ s departure is a clear sign that the president had concluded the administration ’ s foreign-policy decision-making process wasn ’ t working anymore . “ It ’ s not that the president doesn ’ t like hearing from people with different points of view   he does   ” says James Carafano   director of foreign-policy studies at the Heritage Foundation in Washington . “ It ’ s really about the relationship with the president   and how he feels the process is going – and clearly the president had decided the decision-making process had bogged down . ” Mr. Carafano notes that the president turned to Mr. Bolton at another point in his presidency when he felt the process had slowed and was tempering his instincts for bold diplomatic action . “ The president wanted to move to a faster execution of foreign policy than he was getting ” with former national security adviser H.R . McMaster   he says   “ and he got that more aggressive execution with Bolton and Pompeo coming in . ” But with the sharp differences that were dividing the national security team – including between Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo – the process was once again slowing beyond the president ’ s tolerance   says Mr. Carafano   who has close links to the White House . The question now shifts to whom Mr. Trump will name to replace Mr. Bolton – and what signals he will send by the choice he makes . With Mr. Bolton out of the way   some with close knowledge of Mr. Trump ’ s foreign-policy preferences say they expect to see more of the showman ’ s high-profile diplomatic initiatives   including such possibilities as another summit with North Korea ’ s Mr. Kim and revived diplomacy with the Taliban to get an Afghanistan peace deal before next year ’ s election . Some even speculate that Mr. Trump could push for the ultimate showstopper   a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly session in New York later this month .

9SAdod48kIQFMzQS,Christian Science Monitor,The idea of a team of rivals serving the president best by offering an array of passionately held and clashing views for the chief executive to ponder has been around since at least Abraham Lincoln . And for the last 17 months of Donald Trump ’ s presidency   the White House has depicted the president as relishing the strong and often conflicting positions within his national security team – and above all between Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and the famously self-assertive and acerbic national security adviser   John Bolton . That portrayal took a hit Tuesday when Mr. Trump abruptly announced through a tweet that he was firing Mr. Bolton   with whom he said he had often “ strongly disagreed. ” Mr. Bolton said he had resigned . The president went on to hint at the widely known reality that Mr. Bolton had increasingly found himself the White House odd man out – both in personality and in viewpoint on issues from Iran to North Korea and Afghanistan . “ I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions   ” Mr. Trump tweeted   “ as did others in the Administration . ” Whether it was by firing or resignation   Mr. Bolton ’ s departure had seemed inevitable for a while . Yet what spelled the doom of Mr. Trump ’ s third national security adviser in less than three years was not so much his strong views on key foreign-policy issues   former officials and national security analysts say . Rather   it was his take-charge approach to issues   among them Iran and Venezuela   that annoyed a president who may appreciate hearing different viewpoints but does not like being pushed in directions his gut tells him he doesn ’ t want to go . Moreover   the president does not tolerate any suggestion   particularly to the press or the public generally   that anyone but him is in charge . “ Trump likes a multiplicity of advisers presenting a variety of approaches   but he is very averse to situations where his advisers are ganging up on him and leading him to a certain line of thinking – that he does not like   ” says Peter Feaver   a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University in Durham   North Carolina . “ It ’ s one thing if the president hasn ’ t decided what to do   but it ’ s quite another if the president has decided to go left   and his adviser is there saying   ‘ No no no   you ’ ve got to go right . ’ ” Indeed Professor Feaver   who directed national security strategy planning during President George W. Bush ’ s second term   says it was some of Mr. Bolton ’ s same qualities that originally drew Mr. Trump ’ s interest – above all his frequent smart   attack-dog commentaries on foreign policy   usually on Fox News – that ended up souring the relationship between the two . “ At the very same time [ in 2017 ] that the president ’ s advisers were advising him to stay in the JCPOA   ” the six-nation nuclear agreement with Iran   “ there was John Bolton on TV saying very effectively and compellingly to the president ’ s ears that what the president wanted to do – which was to get out of the JCPOA – was the right thing to do   ” Professor Feaver says . But before long it would be precisely that public assertiveness that would begin irritating Mr. Trump . In particular   he was put off by Mr. Bolton ’ s early interaction with the press that suggested he was running the Iran and Venezuela policies . When Mr. Bolton ’ s entourage suggested over the weekend to some media contacts that it was Mr. Bolton who had prevailed in squelching a surprise Camp David meeting with the Taliban to sign a peace deal ending the U.S. war in Afghanistan   it was seen by some as the last straw .

By this spring   relations between the president and his national security adviser had chilled considerably   as Mr. Bolton seemed increasingly dissonant with the president ’ s preference for big deals and showy diplomacy   such as his three unprecedented meetings with North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Un .

Moreover   the president does not tolerate any suggestion   particularly to the press or the public generally   that anyone but him is in charge . “ Trump likes a multiplicity of advisers presenting a variety of approaches   but he is very averse to situations where his advisers are ganging up on him and leading him to a certain line of thinking – that he does not like   ” says Peter Feaver   a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University in Durham   North Carolina . “ It ’ s one thing if the president hasn ’ t decided what to do   but it ’ s quite another if the president has decided to go left   and his adviser is there saying   ‘ No no no   you ’ ve got to go right . ’ ” Indeed Professor Feaver   who directed national security strategy planning during President George W. Bush ’ s second term   says it was some of Mr. Bolton ’ s same qualities that originally drew Mr. Trump ’ s interest – above all his frequent smart   attack-dog commentaries on foreign policy   usually on Fox News – that ended up souring the relationship between the two . “ At the very same time [ in 2017 ] that the president ’ s advisers were advising him to stay in the JCPOA   ” the six-nation nuclear agreement with Iran   “ there was John Bolton on TV saying very effectively and compellingly to the president ’ s ears that what the president wanted to do – which was to get out of the JCPOA – was the right thing to do   ” Professor Feaver says . But before long it would be precisely that public assertiveness that would begin irritating Mr. Trump . In particular   he was put off by Mr. Bolton ’ s early interaction with the press that suggested he was running the Iran and Venezuela policies . When Mr. Bolton ’ s entourage suggested over the weekend to some media contacts that it was Mr. Bolton who had prevailed in squelching a surprise Camp David meeting with the Taliban to sign a peace deal ending the U.S. war in Afghanistan   it was seen by some as the last straw . And that despite the president having indeed agreed with his national security adviser by nixing the high-profile meeting .

Former officials and analysts say Mr. Bolton ’ s take-charge approach to issues annoyed the president . By this spring   relations between the president and his national security adviser had chilled considerably   as Mr. Bolton seemed increasingly dissonant with the president ’ s preference for big deals and showy diplomacy   such as his three unprecedented meetings with North Korea ’ s Kim Jong Un . Indeed   at the same time in late June that Mr. Trump was crossing the border between the two Koreas to meet Mr. Kim for the third time   Mr. Bolton was in Mongolia – dispatched there by a president who wanted an adviser who had called for regime change in North Korea nowhere in sight . And then there was Iran . Mr. Trump was fine with Mr. Pompeo ’ s “ maximum pressure ” campaign largely reliant on increasingly tough sanctions to get Tehran to the negotiating table . But he was less comfortable with Mr. Bolton ’ s push for a more belligerent approach to the Iranian regime . When Mr. Trump at the last minute called off a military strike on Iran in retaliation for the shoot-down in June of a U.S. drone   some White House and State Department officials quipped privately that Mr. Bolton had brought the president to within 10 minutes of a war he didn ’ t want . “ I temper John   which is pretty amazing   ” Mr. Trump mused last spring . For some analysts with close contacts with the Trump White House   Mr. Bolton ’ s departure is a clear sign that the president had concluded the administration ’ s foreign-policy decision-making process wasn ’ t working anymore . “ It ’ s not that the president doesn ’ t like hearing from people with different points of view   he does   ” says James Carafano   director of foreign-policy studies at the Heritage Foundation in Washington . “ It ’ s really about the relationship with the president   and how he feels the process is going – and clearly the president had decided the decision-making process had bogged down . ” Mr. Carafano notes that the president turned to Mr. Bolton at another point in his presidency when he felt the process had slowed and was tempering his instincts for bold diplomatic action . “ The president wanted to move to a faster execution of foreign policy than he was getting ” with former national security adviser H.R . McMaster   he says   “ and he got that more aggressive execution with Bolton and Pompeo coming in . ” But with the sharp differences that were dividing the national security team – including between Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo – the process was once again slowing beyond the president ’ s tolerance   says Mr. Carafano   who has close links to the White House . The question now shifts to whom Mr. Trump will name to replace Mr. Bolton – and what signals he will send by the choice he makes . With Mr. Bolton out of the way   some with close knowledge of Mr. Trump ’ s foreign-policy preferences say they expect to see more of the showman ’ s high-profile diplomatic initiatives   including such possibilities as another summit with North Korea ’ s Mr. Kim and revived diplomacy with the Taliban to get an Afghanistan peace deal before next year ’ s election . Some even speculate that Mr. Trump could push for the ultimate showstopper   a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly session in New York later this month . What no one expects to see is another national security adviser with the brash personality and big public presence of John Bolton . “ If I had to guess I ’ d say it would be someone who is aligned with Mike Pompeo   because right now Pompeo has the most influential voice with the president on national security issues   ” says Duke ’ s Dr. Feaver . Indeed   one name being tossed around as a potential candidate for the job is Brian Hook   Secretary Pompeo ’ s senior policy adviser on Iran . “ And this time around the president may go for someone with a lower public profile who can make the trains run on time   ” he adds   “ and cut down on the drama . ”,Forbes,center,center,center
9SAdod48kIQFMzQS,Christian Science Monitor,The idea of a team of rivals serving the president best by offering an array of passionately held and clashing views for the chief executive to ponder has been around since at least Abraham Lincoln . And for the last 17 months of Donald Trump ’ s presidency   the White House has depicted the president as relishing the strong and often conflicting positions within his national security team – and above all between Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and the famously self-assertive and acerbic national security adviser   John Bolton . That portrayal took a hit Tuesday when Mr. Trump abruptly announced through a tweet that he was firing Mr. Bolton   with whom he said he had often “ strongly disagreed. ” Mr. Bolton said he had resigned .

McMaster   he says   “ and he got that more aggressive execution with Bolton and Pompeo coming in . ” But with the sharp differences that were dividing the national security team – including between Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo – the process was once again slowing beyond the president ’ s tolerance   says Mr. Carafano   who has close links to the White House . The question now shifts to whom Mr. Trump will name to replace Mr. Bolton – and what signals he will send by the choice he makes . With Mr. Bolton out of the way   some with close knowledge of Mr. Trump ’ s foreign-policy preferences say they expect to see more of the showman ’ s high-profile diplomatic initiatives   including such possibilities as another summit with North Korea ’ s Mr. Kim and revived diplomacy with the Taliban to get an Afghanistan peace deal before next year ’ s election . Some even speculate that Mr. Trump could push for the ultimate showstopper   a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly session in New York later this month . What no one expects to see is another national security adviser with the brash personality and big public presence of John Bolton . “ If I had to guess I ’ d say it would be someone who is aligned with Mike Pompeo   because right now Pompeo has the most influential voice with the president on national security issues   ” says Duke ’ s Dr. Feaver . Indeed   one name being tossed around as a potential candidate for the job is Brian Hook   Secretary Pompeo ’ s senior policy adviser on Iran . “ And this time around the president may go for someone with a lower public profile who can make the trains run on time   ” he adds   “ and cut down on the drama . ”,Breitbart News,right,center,right
