        "content": "For Next President , The Fight Against Extremism Will Hit Closer To Home\nAs candidates hit the campaign trail , NPR looks at four major issues the next president will face from Day 1 in office .\nThis week , the FBI arrested a 20-year-old Texas man named Asher Abid Khan on allegations that he intended to join the self-proclaimed Islamic State . He joins more than 60 young American men and women who have been lured to Syria by the group , also known as ISIS . What makes Khan 's case a little different , though , is the way in which he was arrested by authorities . He had been in Australia and then traveled to Turkey and was about to cross into Syria when his parents sent him a frantic message . They claimed his mother was in the hospital and was desperate to see him . The ruse worked . He left Turkey , flew to Texas and was finally arrested Tuesday , nearly a year after his return . It is unclear whether his parents ' participation in convincing him to come home will have some bearing on any eventual sentence \u2014 he has been charged with material support to a terrorist organization and faces up to 15 years in prison .\nKhan 's case is important because it is an indication of the creativity law enforcement officials are starting to employ to stem the flow of American Muslims to ISIS ; and it foreshadows the scope of the problem facing the next president from his or her first day in office .\nIn the past two years , nearly 200 Americans have either tried to travel to Syria and were stopped , are actively considering going , or have actually made it to the ISIS battlefields there . Al-Qaida has never had that kind of attraction and appeal in the U.S . The threat of prison clearly is n't solving the problem . So law enforcement officials are starting to entertain alternatives , and that means the next president will likely have to do so as well .\nThe one thing everyone seems to agree with in regard to ISIS is that it is fundamentally different from al-Qaida . Its leader , Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , sees himself as a religious figure , a descendant of the prophet who has been chosen to create a homeland , or caliphate , for the world 's Muslims . Osama bin Laden , the founder of al-Qaida , fancied himself a warrior , locking horns with the West . A caliphate , he said , could come later . Similarly , ISIS ' goals \u2014 at least at this point \u2014 are different . While bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahiri are focused on attacking the U.S. ; ISIS is endlessly creative in trying to get young men and women to leave home to create a state in Syria and Iraq .\nIf you do n't want to fight , its recruitment videos say , not to worry , you can be a plumber or an electrician or a traffic cop in the new caliphate . ISIS does n't lure young men and women from around the world with the long audio diatribes bin Laden and al-Zawahiri have always favored , instead the group has been more creative . For example , it re-created its own version of the popular video game Grand Theft Auto . Download the game and you can shoot up Syrian troops , or local police , and get a dose of ISIS propaganda at the same time .\n`` I do n't think al-Qaida ever had that kind of talent , '' says Tony Sgro , the CEO of a San Francisco company called EdVenture Partners which , among other things , markets to exactly the kind of people who are attracted by ISIS ' sales pitch . `` I personally do n't remember them being such a world-class employment , branding and recruiting agency . But ISIL is . ''\nSgro is the man behind `` Peer 2 Peer : Challenging Extremism , '' a university-based program that is focused on competing with groups like ISIS or ISIL . The initiative brings together college students from all kinds of disciplines \u2014 from marketing to international relations to computer science \u2014 and creates a college class that gets them to dream up social media campaigns that will challenge groups like ISIS online . `` You know universities are like dense pockets of humanity and it 's been fascinating to see the way these faculty , and more importantly the students , view the challenge with different optics , '' Sgro said .\nThe program is premised on the idea that the 50-year-olds at the State or Defense Departments do n't know what animates 20-somethings attracted to ISIS , but their peers do . The question is : Will it work ? And will the next president , looking for creative solutions to counter ISIS , pursue this kind of strategy ?\nGround zero for another experiment \u2014 an attempt at deradicalizing young men and women seduced by ISIS ' social media campaign \u2014 started just this year in Minnesota . Until recently , U.S. counterterrorism officials dismissed the efficacy of deradicalization programs . The number of Americans who radicalized and embraced groups like al-Qaida was so small , there was little enthusiasm for developing a program to change their mindsets . The thinking was that prison time could do that . Then ISIS happened , and with dozens of Americans leaving for the Middle East , law enforcement officials , particularly at the Justice Department , seem more open to the idea . According to federal law enforcement officials , the Twin Cities alone are home to some 40 young men and women who are either establishing ties with ISIS members or have tried to join them .\nEarlier this month , at a pretrial hearing in Minneapolis , U.S. District Court Judge Michael Davis told five young Somali-Americans who were arrested before they could board planes bound for Syria that he 'd consider moving them into halfway houses while they awaited trial if their lawyers could come up with a creative limited release program . Spectators in the courtroom were stunned . So far , just one young man , Abdullahi Yusuf , has been allowed to enroll in a program like that . He , too , is in Minneapolis . A 19-year-old former football player at the local high school , Yusuf was caught trying to board a flight to Turkey more than a year ago . The judge offered him a rehab program ; a woman named Mary McKinley is in the process of creating one .\n`` We have n't done this before , not very many people have done this before , so we 're going slow , '' said McKinley . She 's the executive director of Heartland Democracy , a Minnesota nonprofit , who was asked to create the jihadi rehabilitation program . `` The proposal that we submitted to the court was a series of work we 'd already done , conversations we had and ideas going forward . '' The early curriculum reads like the syllabus from a civics class : Writings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , selections from the Constitution , Malcolm X . It is unclear whether the latest batch of possible rehabilitation candidates will get the same reading list or whether McKinley will be asked to work with them as well , but it is progress .\nThe U.S. attorney in Minnesota is a man named Andrew Luger . An official in his office familiar with Luger 's thinking said he believed that when it came to rehabilitation for ISIS travelers , the U.S. attorney 's thinking `` is evolving . '' Luger fought Abdullahi Yusuf 's release at the beginning of the year , but has since softened his position . He did n't object when the judge suggested they possibly include more young men from the Twin Cities in some sort of program . While all these alleged ISIS travelers are likely to serve some jail time , participating in a rehab program could whittle down their sentences or be used to smooth their transition back into the community when they get out . Deradicalization is a policy choice the next president faces .\nFinally , from Day 1 , the next president will likely have to make some hard decisions about drones . The program began in secrecy and is now the stuff of popular culture . Ethan Hawke has just opened a new movie called Good Kill , in which he plays a drone pilot who is having doubts about the targets chosen and the civilians drones might kill . These are the very issues the next president will have to address . `` The pressure is growing . Certainly when you go overseas , drones do not have a favorable image , '' said James Lewis , a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . `` I think they are really beneficial , I think we have to use them , but we 've got to take that unfavorable reaction into account . ''\nThat reaction hit closer to home just last month when President Obama came into the White House briefing room to announce that an American aid worker and another man held hostage by al-Qaida were killed in an American drone strike . The attack had taken place in Pakistan in January . The CIA authorized the attack on a compound linked to al-Qaida without realizing that the two hostages were being held there . The U.S. had reportedly done hundreds of hours of surveillance over the target , but failed to realize that hostages were there . President Obama took full responsibility and promised a reassessment of the program . `` We 're going to review what happened , '' he said . `` We 're gon na identify the lessons that can be learned and any improvements and changes that can be made . ''\nThe next president will likely have to do the same from Day 1 .",

According to federal law enforcement officials, the Twin Cities alone are home to some 40 young men and women who are either establishing ties with ISIS members or have tried to join them.\n\nEarlier this month, at a pretrial hearing in Minneapolis, U.S. District Court Judge Michael Davis told five young Somali-Americans who were arrested before they could board planes bound for Syria that he'd consider moving them into halfway houses while they awaited trial if their lawyers could come up with a creative limited release program. Spectators in the courtroom were stunned. So far, just one young man, Abdullahi Yusuf, has been allowed to enroll in a program like that. He, too, is in Minneapolis. A 19-year-old former football player at the local high school, Yusuf was caught trying to board a flight to Turkey more than a year ago. The judge offered him a rehab program; a woman named Mary McKinley is in the process of creating one.\n\n\"We haven't done this before, not very many people have done this before, so we're going slow,\" said McKinley. She's the executive director of Heartland Democracy, a Minnesota nonprofit, who was asked to create the jihadi rehabilitation program. \"The proposal that we submitted to the court was a series of work we'd already done, conversations we had and ideas going forward.\" The early curriculum reads like the syllabus from a civics class: Writings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., selections from the Constitution, Malcolm X. It is unclear whether the latest batch of possible rehabilitation candidates will get the same reading list or whether McKinley will be asked to work with them as well, but it is progress.\n\nThe U.S. attorney in Minnesota is a man named Andrew Luger. An official in his office familiar with Luger's thinking said he believed that when it came to rehabilitation for ISIS travelers, the U.S. attorney's thinking \"is evolving.\" Luger fought Abdullahi Yusuf's release at the beginning of the year, but has since softened his position. He didn't object when the judge suggested they possibly include more young men from the Twin Cities in some sort of program. While all these alleged ISIS travelers are likely to serve some jail time, participating in a rehab program could whittle down their sentences or be used to smooth their transition back into the community when they get out. Deradicalization is a policy choice the next president faces.\n\nFinally, from Day 1, the next president will likely have to make some hard decisions about drones. The program began in secrecy and is now the stuff of popular culture. Ethan Hawke has just opened a new movie called Good Kill, in which he plays a drone pilot who is having doubts about the targets chosen and the civilians drones might kill. These are the very issues the next president will have to address. \"The pressure is growing. Certainly when you go overseas, drones do not have a favorable image,\" said James Lewis, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"I think they are really beneficial, I think we have to use them, but we've got to take that unfavorable reaction into account.\"\n\nThat reaction hit closer to home just last month when President Obama came into the White House briefing room to announce that an American aid worker and another man held hostage by al-Qaida were killed in an American drone strike. The attack had taken place in Pakistan in January. The CIA authorized the attack on a compound linked to al-Qaida without realizing that the two hostages were being held there. The U.S. had reportedly done hundreds of hours of surveillance over the target, but failed to realize that hostages were there. President Obama took full responsibility and promised a reassessment of the program. \"We're going to review what happened,\" he said. \"We're gonna identify the lessons that can be learned and any improvements and changes that can be made.\"\n\nThe next president will likely have to do the same from Day 1.",

        "content": "AITKIN , Minn.\u2014The plumbers , drillers and truck drivers who arrive at the Birchwood Cafe before sunrise pour their own coffee , tuck away eggs and air gripes that help explain why some longtime Democrats now lean Republican .\nThey are skeptical of President Barack Obama and don \u2019 t care much for his party \u2019 s support of federal safety-net programs . \u201c You take a look at all the giveaway programs the Democrats have . Nobody wants to work anymore , \u201d said Dale Lundquist , a 69-year-old excavation contractor .\nVoters in this northeast Minnesota district have only once sent a Republican to Congress since 1947\u2014for a single term after the 2010 election that produced a wave for the GOP .\nBut Mr. Lundquist , a former Democrat , and some of his friends say they plan to vote for Stewart Mills , the Republican challenger to Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan , one reason the race is down to the wire\u2014and why the GOP is likely to expand its House majority in Tuesday \u2019 s election .\nDemocrats have long been losing their hold on districts such as this one , largely white and rural , where incomes lag the national average and college graduates are relatively sparse . This year , Republicans may take more .\nSeven of the 39 House races rated most competitive by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report are in districts with large numbers of white , working-class voters ; six of those districts are held by Democrats . In addition , one other such Democratic district is seen as likely to flip Republican .\nIn West Virginia , for example , 19-term Rep. Nick Rahall , the seventh most-senior House member , is battling for survival . A district in southern Illinois , represented by Democrats for more than two decades , and northern Maine , where a six-term Democrat is leaving office , are tossups . And Democrats are struggling to hold two seats in Minnesota , including Mr. Nolan \u2019 s sprawling district , which stretches from the Minneapolis exurbs to the U.S.-Canada border .\nNonpartisan political analysts expect Republicans to win somewhere between two and 10 additional House seats . A gain of 12 districts would match the Republican Party \u2019 s post-World War II record of 246 seats in 1947 .\nReclaiming white , working-class voters is a tall order for Democrats , who have won the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections with broad support from minorities , single women and younger voters . Democrats have won national elections with the message that government should help people through such programs as subsidized student loans , food stamps and the Affordable Care Act .\nDemocrats say they can bridge cultural differences and draw white , working-class voters by pushing for a higher minimum wage , for example , and other policies they contend foster economic opportunity . \u201c The white working class hasn \u2019 t had a raise in 20 years , \u201d said Celinda Lake , a Democratic Party strategist . \u201c Economics can unite these constituencies , whereas sometimes the social issues can divide them . \u201d\nBut some voters resent paying for federal programs they say discourage hard work and individual responsibility . In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in June , 53 % of white voters said the government was doing too many things to meet the needs of people , help that should be left to businesses and individuals , compared with 32 % of African-Americans and 44 % of Hispanics .\nFederal programs used to be a safety net , said Dan Anderson , a 52-year-old highway construction worker from Duluth , Minn. , another town in Mr. Nolan \u2019 s district . \u201c Now it \u2019 s a way of life for a lot of people . \u201d\nMr. Anderson supports the long-standing federal government programs of Social Security and Medicare . \u201c There are programs we have to have , \u201d he said , but worried the government was overextending its reach . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to take care of the needy , it \u2019 s just growing into too much . \u201d\nA distinction , said Mr. Lundquist , the excavator , is that \u201c we worked and paid for \u201d Social Security and Medicare . Another Birchwood Cafe regular , masonry contractor Carl Kurtz , 62 , said he worried federal safety-net programs have allowed people to depend too much on the federal government . \u201c All they \u2019 ve done is absolutely destroy the black family. \u201d he said , \u201c and ruined a lot of white families around here , too . \u201d\nIn Aitkin , the seat of Aitkin County , the bowling alley draws a good lunch crowd and local groups host charity \u201c meat raffles \u201d that send winners home with pounds of meat . The county used to regularly tilt Democratic , but now swings between parties . Mr. Obama won the county in 2008 and lost it in 2012 .\nFormer Rep. Barton Gordon of Tennessee , a Democrat , said distrust of government was pervasive in many of the largely-rural districts that have tipped Republican . His own white , working-class district was won by Republican Rep. Diane Black after he retired in 2010 .\n\u201c There became a feeling that the Democratic Party was the party that took money from people that worked and gave it to people that didn \u2019 t work , \u201d Mr. Gordon said . The party \u2019 s tone on social issues also alienated some voters , he said : \u201c Whether it \u2019 s guns or gays or religion , it was almost like the Democratic establishment made fun of those things . \u201d\nAs a group , Republican candidates in the region this year have focused on the pro-business , small-government planks of the GOP platform . Some have avoided the social issues familiar in the campaigns of their peers in more conservative states .\nThe Democrats \u2019 declining support among white , working-class voters began decades ago . In 1993 , for example , Democrats held 36 of the 71 districts that The Wall Street Journal counted as largely white and working-class . Today , Democrats hold just 11 of 70 such districts among the House \u2019 s 435 seats .\nMr. Nolan \u2019 s 8th congressional district is almost 93 % white , with more than half of its residents of German , Norwegian or Swedish heritage . The median household income is $ 49,860 , below the U.S. median of $ 53,000 ; a bit more than 22 % of residents have a bachelor \u2019 s degree or higher , below the national median of 28.5 % , according to the Census Bureau .\nMr. Nolan , a 70-year-old former businessman , served in Congress from 1975 until 1981 . He successfully ran again in 2012 , when Mr. Obama beat former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney in his largely rural district 51.5 % to 46 % .\nAitkin , Minn. , the seat of Aitkin County , used to regularly tilt Democratic but now swings between parties . Jenn Ackerman for The Wall Street Journal\nFor decades , the congressional district was a stronghold of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party\u2014the state \u2019 s Democratic Party\u2014supported by unions for miners and other workers . But as mining became more automated , reducing jobs , the population shrank . The redrawing of district lines after the 1990 and 2000 Census , along with more recent population growth in the district \u2019 s exurbs , have brought in more conservative residents .\nDemocrats control the Minnesota state Legislature , and polls show Democratic Gov . Mark Dayton with a comfortable lead . But Mr. Nolan has a formidable challenger in Mr. Mills , vice president of his family \u2019 s Mills Fleet Farm , a chain of more than 30 stores selling sporting goods and gardening supplies . Mr. Mills , age 42 , supports gun rights and his stores sell guns and ammunition . He also administers a health plan for more than 6,000 of his employees , bringing personal experience to his arguments against the health-care law .\nMr. Mills first drew attention in January 2013 , with an online video challenging Mr. Nolan \u2019 s support for an assault weapons ban and his comment , \u201c I don \u2019 t need an assault weapon to shoot a duck. \u201d The video showed Fleet Farm employees shooting targets at the company \u2019 s firing range to illustrate how shotguns could be more destructive than a semiautomatic rifle , which would be banned under the proposal .\n\u201c In Rick Nolan \u2019 s version of the Second Amendment , we can only have hunting guns , \u201d Mr. Mills said in an interview . \u201c The Republicans are a much better fit for representing the ideals and the priorities for our part of Minnesota . \u201d\nMr. Nolan also backs the Second Amendment , he said , adding \u201c reasonable restrictions have always been a part of our freedoms . \u201d\nMr. Nolan favors a more expansive role for government , including a higher minimum wage , more federal spending on infrastructure and the Affordable Care Act , though with proposed changes . The goal , he said in the campaign , should be a single-payer health system , similar to Medicare .\n\u201c We all do better when we all do better , \u201d Mr. Nolan said .\nGrace Wagner , a 69-year-old farmer , favors Mr. Nolan \u2019 s views and said she has already voted for him by absentee ballot . She credited his support for such programs as fuel assistance and home-weatherization aid .\n\u201c When you \u2019 re on a strict income , it really helps , \u201d she said , while selling produce at a farmer \u2019 s market in Duluth , Minn .\nIn its analysis , The Wall Street Journal included districts that in 1993 had a white population of greater than 85 % , median household income under $ 30,000 and fewer than 17 % of residents with a bachelor \u2019 s degree . To account for inflation and changes in the U.S. population , the Journal analysis counted districts in 2014 with populations greater than 70 % white , median household income under $ 50,000 and less than 25 % of adults with a bachelor \u2019 s degree . For both years , the Journal \u2019 s benchmarks were intended to identify districts that were slightly lower income , had a larger white population and fewer college graduates than the U.S. as a whole .\nWhite , working-class voters play an outsize role in House races largely because of where they live . The U.S. is about evenly split between the two parties , but Democrats are more clustered in cities and Republicans are dispersed more evenly . As a result , Democrats tend to dominate a smaller number of urban districts while Republicans win more districts , though by slimmer margins .\nRepublican-controlled redistricting strengthened the party \u2019 s advantage for House races . After the 2010 census , Republicans controlled both the legislature and governor \u2019 s office in far more states than Democrats did . That enabled the party to redraw congressional boundaries with more Republican-leaning neighborhoods , creating safer GOP districts .\nBut favorable district lines generally don \u2019 t help in presidential elections because most votes are counted statewide . Many Republicans worry the party \u2019 s strength among white voters isn \u2019 t nearly enough to win national elections . In 2012 , for example , Mr. Romney won 59 % of the white vote but lost to Mr. Obama , who carried 80 % support of nonwhite voters .\nFor Republicans , the concern is that the proportion of white voters continues to decline in presidential elections . Some worry the next Democratic presidential nominee could draw a larger share than Mr. Obama did , hurting GOP chances at the White House .\nIn Aitkin , retired state trooper and Vietnam veteran Tom Druar , 65 years old , said he loved President John F.

        "content_original": "AITKIN, Minn.\u2014The plumbers, drillers and truck drivers who arrive at the Birchwood Cafe before sunrise pour their own coffee, tuck away eggs and air gripes that help explain why some longtime Democrats now lean Republican.\n\nThey are skeptical of President Barack Obama and don\u2019t care much for his party\u2019s support of federal safety-net programs. \u201cYou take a look at all the giveaway programs the Democrats have. Nobody wants to work anymore,\u201d said Dale Lundquist, a 69-year-old excavation contractor.\n\nVoters in this northeast Minnesota district have only once sent a Republican to Congress since 1947\u2014for a single term after the 2010 election that produced a wave for the GOP.\n\nBut Mr. Lundquist, a former Democrat, and some of his friends say they plan to vote for Stewart Mills, the Republican challenger to Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan, one reason the race is down to the wire\u2014and why the GOP is likely to expand its House majority in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nDemocrats have long been losing their hold on districts such as this one, largely white and rural, where incomes lag the national average and college graduates are relatively sparse. This year, Republicans may take more.\n\nSeven of the 39 House races rated most competitive by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report are in districts with large numbers of white, working-class voters; six of those districts are held by Democrats. In addition, one other such Democratic district is seen as likely to flip Republican.\n\nIn West Virginia, for example, 19-term Rep. Nick Rahall, the seventh most-senior House member, is battling for survival. A district in southern Illinois, represented by Democrats for more than two decades, and northern Maine, where a six-term Democrat is leaving office, are tossups. And Democrats are struggling to hold two seats in Minnesota, including Mr. Nolan\u2019s sprawling district, which stretches from the Minneapolis exurbs to the U.S.-Canada border.\n\nNonpartisan political analysts expect Republicans to win somewhere between two and 10 additional House seats. A gain of 12 districts would match the Republican Party\u2019s post-World War II record of 246 seats in 1947.\n\nReclaiming white, working-class voters is a tall order for Democrats, who have won the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections with broad support from minorities, single women and younger voters. Democrats have won national elections with the message that government should help people through such programs as subsidized student loans, food stamps and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDemocrats say they can bridge cultural differences and draw white, working-class voters by pushing for a higher minimum wage, for example, and other policies they contend foster economic opportunity. \u201cThe white working class hasn\u2019t had a raise in 20 years,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic Party strategist. \u201cEconomics can unite these constituencies, whereas sometimes the social issues can divide them.\u201d\n\nBut some voters resent paying for federal programs they say discourage hard work and individual responsibility. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in June, 53% of white voters said the government was doing too many things to meet the needs of people, help that should be left to businesses and individuals, compared with 32% of African-Americans and 44% of Hispanics.\n\nFederal programs used to be a safety net, said Dan Anderson, a 52-year-old highway construction worker from Duluth, Minn., another town in Mr. Nolan\u2019s district. \u201cNow it\u2019s a way of life for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nMr. Anderson supports the long-standing federal government programs of Social Security and Medicare. \u201cThere are programs we have to have,\u201d he said, but worried the government was overextending its reach. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take care of the needy, it\u2019s just growing into too much.\u201d\n\nA distinction, said Mr. Lundquist, the excavator, is that \u201cwe worked and paid for\u201d Social Security and Medicare. Another Birchwood Cafe regular, masonry contractor Carl Kurtz, 62, said he worried federal safety-net programs have allowed people to depend too much on the federal government. \u201cAll they\u2019ve done is absolutely destroy the black family.\u201d he said, \u201cand ruined a lot of white families around here, too.\u201d\n\nIn Aitkin, the seat of Aitkin County, the bowling alley draws a good lunch crowd and local groups host charity \u201cmeat raffles\u201d that send winners home with pounds of meat. The county used to regularly tilt Democratic, but now swings between parties. Mr. Obama won the county in 2008 and lost it in 2012.\n\nFormer Rep. Barton Gordon of Tennessee, a Democrat, said distrust of government was pervasive in many of the largely-rural districts that have tipped Republican. His own white, working-class district was won by Republican Rep. Diane Black after he retired in 2010.\n\n\u201cThere became a feeling that the Democratic Party was the party that took money from people that worked and gave it to people that didn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. The party\u2019s tone on social issues also alienated some voters, he said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s guns or gays or religion, it was almost like the Democratic establishment made fun of those things.\u201d\n\nAs a group, Republican candidates in the region this year have focused on the pro-business, small-government planks of the GOP platform. Some have avoided the social issues familiar in the campaigns of their peers in more conservative states.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 declining support among white, working-class voters began decades ago. In 1993, for example, Democrats held 36 of the 71 districts that The Wall Street Journal counted as largely white and working-class. Today, Democrats hold just 11 of 70 such districts among the House\u2019s 435 seats.\n\nMr. Nolan\u2019s 8th congressional district is almost 93% white, with more than half of its residents of German, Norwegian or Swedish heritage. The median household income is $49,860, below the U.S. median of $53,000; a bit more than 22% of residents have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, below the national median of 28.5%, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nMr. Nolan, a 70-year-old former businessman, served in Congress from 1975 until 1981. He successfully ran again in 2012, when Mr. Obama beat former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in his largely rural district 51.5% to 46%.\n\nAitkin, Minn., the seat of Aitkin County, used to regularly tilt Democratic but now swings between parties. Jenn Ackerman for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor decades, the congressional district was a stronghold of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party\u2014the state\u2019s Democratic Party\u2014supported by unions for miners and other workers. But as mining became more automated, reducing jobs, the population shrank. The redrawing of district lines after the 1990 and 2000 Census, along with more recent population growth in the district\u2019s exurbs, have brought in more conservative residents.\n\nDemocrats control the Minnesota state Legislature, and polls show Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton with a comfortable lead. But Mr. Nolan has a formidable challenger in Mr. Mills, vice president of his family\u2019s Mills Fleet Farm, a chain of more than 30 stores selling sporting goods and gardening supplies. Mr. Mills, age 42, supports gun rights and his stores sell guns and ammunition. He also administers a health plan for more than 6,000 of his employees, bringing personal experience to his arguments against the health-care law.\n\nMr. Mills first drew attention in January 2013, with an online video challenging Mr. Nolan\u2019s support for an assault weapons ban and his comment, \u201cI don\u2019t need an assault weapon to shoot a duck.\u201d The video showed Fleet Farm employees shooting targets at the company\u2019s firing range to illustrate how shotguns could be more destructive than a semiautomatic rifle, which would be banned under the proposal.\n\n\u201cIn Rick Nolan\u2019s version of the Second Amendment, we can only have hunting guns,\u201d Mr. Mills said in an interview. \u201cThe Republicans are a much better fit for representing the ideals and the priorities for our part of Minnesota.\u201d\n\nMr. Nolan also backs the Second Amendment, he said, adding \u201creasonable restrictions have always been a part of our freedoms.\u201d\n\nMr. Nolan favors a more expansive role for government, including a higher minimum wage, more federal spending on infrastructure and the Affordable Care Act, though with proposed changes. The goal, he said in the campaign, should be a single-payer health system, similar to Medicare.\n\n\u201cWe all do better when we all do better,\u201d Mr. Nolan said.\n\nGrace Wagner, a 69-year-old farmer, favors Mr. Nolan\u2019s views and said she has already voted for him by absentee ballot. She credited his support for such programs as fuel assistance and home-weatherization aid.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a strict income, it really helps,\u201d she said, while selling produce at a farmer\u2019s market in Duluth, Minn.\n\nIn its analysis, The Wall Street Journal included districts that in 1993 had a white population of greater than 85%, median household income under $30,000 and fewer than 17% of residents with a bachelor\u2019s degree. To account for inflation and changes in the U.S. population, the Journal analysis counted districts in 2014 with populations greater than 70% white, median household income under $50,000 and less than 25% of adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree. For both years, the Journal\u2019s benchmarks were intended to identify districts that were slightly lower income, had a larger white population and fewer college graduates than the U.S. as a whole.\n\nWhite, working-class voters play an outsize role in House races largely because of where they live. The U.S. is about evenly split between the two parties, but Democrats are more clustered in cities and Republicans are dispersed more evenly. As a result, Democrats tend to dominate a smaller number of urban districts while Republicans win more districts, though by slimmer margins.\n\nRepublican-controlled redistricting strengthened the party\u2019s advantage for House races. After the 2010 census, Republicans controlled both the legislature and governor\u2019s office in far more states than Democrats did. That enabled the party to redraw congressional boundaries with more Republican-leaning neighborhoods, creating safer GOP districts.\n\nBut favorable district lines generally don\u2019t help in presidential elections because most votes are counted statewide. Many Republicans worry the party\u2019s strength among white voters isn\u2019t nearly enough to win national elections. In 2012, for example, Mr. Romney won 59% of the white vote but lost to Mr. Obama, who carried 80% support of nonwhite voters.\n\nFor Republicans, the concern is that the proportion of white voters continues to decline in presidential elections. Some worry the next Democratic presidential nominee could draw a larger share than Mr. Obama did, hurting GOP chances at the White House.\n\nIn Aitkin, retired state trooper and Vietnam veteran Tom Druar, 65 years old, said he loved President John F. Kennedy asking Americans to serve their country. Too many people, he said, are now only looking for what they can get.\n\n\u201cI used to be a conservative Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no more of us.\u201d\n\nWrite to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com",

And in every election since it passed , nearly every Republican candidate , including President Trump , has vowed to get rid of the law and put something better in its place .\nOn Monday evening , House Republicans finally released their own health care proposal . It would replace Obamacare 's mandate to buy insurance and his subsidies to bring down the cost with a fixed refundable tax credit that people can use to buy coverage . Nobody 's required to have a health plan . But if you do n't get covered at the outset , you 'll pay a penalty to buy it later .\nSo does it fix the problems Republicans have laid out ? Likely not .\n`` It 's debatable whether the market is imploding or not , '' says Cynthia Cox , associate director of the Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation .\n`` On one hand , they 're getting rid of the individual mandate [ for most people to buy insurance ] , and that would have the effect of destabilizing the market and raising premiums , '' Cox says .\nAnd the penalty for allowing a gap in your health insurance coverage could help , or it could make it worse , she says .\nThe penalty could be `` a disincentive for healthy people to sign up , '' she says .\nThat 's the central challenge both approaches face . A healthy market needs a lot of healthy people so that premiums are spread across a broad population to care for sick people . Without that , the market struggles to keep costs low and choices high .\nThe Affordable Care Act 's markets have been struggling , no doubt . Several insurance companies have dropped out , leaving some states and counties with only one company offering plans . At the same time , premiums have risen in many markets . Last year , premiums rose an average 22 percent \u2014 though individual cost increases varied because federal subsidies for many people rose in tandem with premiums .\nRyan says he wants consumers to have more choices and lower costs .\n`` Instead of fewer choices , we want our health care system to be truly competitive . Insurers should compete for your business and treat you fairly , '' he said on Feb. 22 . `` All of this will lower cost and end the annual sticker shock of higher premiums . ''\nNot necessarily , says Paul Howard , a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute .\n`` There 's not enough flexibility from the insurers ' point of view to offer lower cost plans , '' he says .\nThat 's because Republicans are hamstrung by politics , he says . They ca n't repeal the Affordable Care Act outright without the help of Democrats , which they wo n't get . So in order to get a bill through , congressional rules say they have to limit it to matters that deal with taxes or the budget .\nWhich means all the benefits that the existing health care law says have to be included in a health insurance policy would remain . And that means insurance companies ca n't offer cheap health plans .\n`` I do n't see it being abundantly clear that premiums will be significantly lower under this bill than they are in the Affordable Care Act , '' says Cox of Kaiser . `` And there is evidence the out-of-pocket costs could go up , '' she says .\nThat 's because the Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to cover the deductibles and copayments for lower-income people . The Ryan plan offers a fixed tax credit \u2014 between $ 2,000 and $ 4,000 depending on age \u2014 that would likely lead many people to buy health plans they have to shell out a lot of money for up front , called high deductible plans .\nCox 's analysis shows that wealthier people get more help from the new Republican plan while lower income people benefit more from Obamacare .\nRepublicans are hamstrung in part by the fact that they ca n't repeal the Affordable Care Act in one go and fully replace it with their own vision .\nEven if the bill did meet Paul Ryan 's goals , it certainly does n't fulfill President Trump 's campaign promises .\n`` Everybody 's got to be covered , '' he said in an interview with 60 Minutes in 2015 . `` This is an un-Republican thing for me to say , because a lot of times they say , 'No , no , the lower 25 percent , they ca n't afford private . ' But I am going to take care of everybody . '' He repeated that goal this past January in an interview with The Washington Post .\nAs it turns out , the Affordable Care Act did n't cover everybody . And early analyses of the Ryan proposal suggest his plan could reach even fewer people .\nA report from Avalere Health and McKinsey estimated that 30 percent of those in the individual health insurance market could drop out if the current subsidies were swapped out for the age-based tax credits .\nHoward of the Manhattan Institute worries that people who are now heavily subsidized will fall away .\n`` I would have some concerns about those low-income folks dropping out of the market , and concerns about whether or not that 30 percent surcharge is going to keep the younger population in the market , '' he said .\nStay tuned . The process of moving the bill through Congress starts Wednesday in the House committees with jurisdiction over health care .",

Last year, premiums rose an average 22 percent \u2014 though individual cost increases varied because federal subsidies for many people rose in tandem with premiums.\n\nRyan says he wants consumers to have more choices and lower costs.\n\n\"Instead of fewer choices, we want our health care system to be truly competitive. Insurers should compete for your business and treat you fairly,\" he said on Feb. 22. \"All of this will lower cost and end the annual sticker shock of higher premiums.\"\n\nWill his plan offer more choices?\n\nNot necessarily, says Paul Howard, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"There's not enough flexibility from the insurers' point of view to offer lower cost plans,\" he says.\n\nThat's because Republicans are hamstrung by politics, he says. They can't repeal the Affordable Care Act outright without the help of Democrats, which they won't get. So in order to get a bill through, congressional rules say they have to limit it to matters that deal with taxes or the budget.\n\nWhich means all the benefits that the existing health care law says have to be included in a health insurance policy would remain. And that means insurance companies can't offer cheap health plans.\n\nThat brings up Ryan's other goal: lowering costs.\n\n\"I don't see it being abundantly clear that premiums will be significantly lower under this bill than they are in the Affordable Care Act,\" says Cox of Kaiser. \"And there is evidence the out-of-pocket costs could go up,\" she says.\n\nThat's because the Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to cover the deductibles and copayments for lower-income people. The Ryan plan offers a fixed tax credit \u2014 between $2,000 and $4,000 depending on age \u2014 that would likely lead many people to buy health plans they have to shell out a lot of money for up front, called high deductible plans.\n\nCox's analysis shows that wealthier people get more help from the new Republican plan while lower income people benefit more from Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans are hamstrung in part by the fact that they can't repeal the Affordable Care Act in one go and fully replace it with their own vision.\n\nEven if the bill did meet Paul Ryan's goals, it certainly doesn't fulfill President Trump's campaign promises.\n\n\"Everybody's got to be covered,\" he said in an interview with 60 Minutes in 2015. \"This is an un-Republican thing for me to say, because a lot of times they say, 'No, no, the lower 25 percent, they can't afford private.' But I am going to take care of everybody.\" He repeated that goal this past January in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nAs it turns out, the Affordable Care Act didn't cover everybody. And early analyses of the Ryan proposal suggest his plan could reach even fewer people.\n\nA report from Avalere Health and McKinsey estimated that 30 percent of those in the individual health insurance market could drop out if the current subsidies were swapped out for the age-based tax credits.\n\nHoward of the Manhattan Institute worries that people who are now heavily subsidized will fall away.\n\n\"I would have some concerns about those low-income folks dropping out of the market, and concerns about whether or not that 30 percent surcharge is going to keep the younger population in the market,\" he said.\n\nStay tuned. The process of moving the bill through Congress starts Wednesday in the House committees with jurisdiction over health care.",

        "content": "He bantered with Larry , a Coralville voter , about the University of Iowa 's hot hoops team . Iowa had better take advantage of Ohio State University , he said . `` Our basketball team is down this year . ''\nKasich \u2019 s signature down-home small talk over , Larry asked the Republican presidential candidate if he supports the Renewable Fuel Standard \u2019 s requirement that gas contain a certain amount of ethanol , much of it made from Iowa corn . Kasich supports the existing law .\n\u201c You keep going , \u201d Larry told Kasich , calling him `` Johnny . '' \u201c If you \u2019 re ever in the great state of Iowa and you \u2019 re close , we \u2019 ll come and wave to ya . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s right : Kasich was talking to Larry , and more than 12,000 other Iowa voters , in a telephone town-hall meeting Thursday night . Kasich was calling from the other early-voting state : New Hampshire .\nKasich is polling at just less than 3 % in Iowa ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses , putting him in ninth , according to the RealClearPolitics rolling average of recent polls . Talk among the Kasich team of a possible top-five finish has faded .\nWhile other candidates have swarmed Iowa this month , Kasich has appeared just twice : Jan. 4 in West Des Moines and Jan. 10 in Council Bluffs . He plans Iowa visits this week in the Quad Cities , Des Moines and Cedar Rapids , but he 's not scheduled to be in Iowa on caucus day .\nInstead , he \u2019 s taking his town-hall game in person to New Hampshire . Ahead of the Feb. 9 primary , he 's in a tight battle with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for second place . Finishing just behind poll-leading Donald Trump , he hopes , could propel him to prominence among establishment Republicans leery of Trump and Cruz , who are topping national surveys .\nHis approach , Kasich and his advisers say , has its roots in reality : It \u2019 s next to impossible to win both contests , so they 're focusing on the state where they have the best shot . The same candidate has won both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary only once in the last seven contested GOP elections : 1976 , the first year Iowa Republicans kicked off the nation \u2019 s voting .\n\u201c I wish I had more time for Iowa , \u201d Kasich said in an interview Wednesday on his campaign bus in New Hampshire . \u201c When we go , we get such good response , so it \u2019 s tempting to keep going back . It \u2019 s time management . It \u2019 s nothing against the folks in Iowa . \u201d\nThe Iowa tele-town halls \u2014 Kasich has held three \u2014 have helped some . On Thursday night , people dropped in and out of the conversation , with as many as 4,375 participants at any time , data from the vendor show . The average participant spent a whopping 32 minutes on the hour-long call , up from 15 minutes and eight minutes in the previous calls . Some Iowans , at least , are interested in Kasich .\nHe told participants on the phone call that he \u2019 d appreciate any boost he can get from their caucus votes .\nWhat about caucusgoers who worry about \u201c throwing away \u201d their votes on a low-polling candidate ?\n\u201c I vote for the person that I like . I don \u2019 t worry about throwing away my vote . I vote for the person who can do a good job , \u201d Kasich said in the interview .\nIn the tele-town halls , Iowans get a taste of the same Kasich they \u2019 d see in person \u2014 minus the teal puffy coat he \u2019 s been wearing this winter , the national debt ticker that decorates his town-hall meetings and the blue bus carting him through the New Hampshire snow .\nWith Kasich , voters get an hour of folksy explanations of complicated policies , plus exhortations to take care of each other , seek a personal purpose , become part of something bigger than themselves .\nHe also makes jokes that make fun of audience members , or himself , or the presidential process . He drops names . ( He \u2019 s friends with John McCain , who twice won the New Hampshire primaries . He got Leonardo DiCaprio \u2019 s autograph for his daughters at a restaurant this month . )\nHe sometimes interrupts questioners or finishes their queries for them .\n\u201c My mind works very fast , you know , and there \u2019 s things that they say that trigger something that I can \u2019 t wait to tell them , \u201d he said in the interview . \u201c I \u2019 m really not trying to cut anybody off , and I \u2019 m certainly not trying to show them any disrespect , but \u2014 can \u2019 t we just kind of get to it ? I \u2019 m just bursting to tell them . \u201d\nRushad Thomas walked right into a Kasich joke Monday night at a town hall in Lebanon , New Hampshire .\n\u201c I think immigration is a good thing , because our population is getting very old-people heavy , \u201d Thomas , 26 , said to the audience , which was also very \u201c old-people heavy , \u201d since the event was at a senior center .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a good thing you \u2019 re not running for president , \u201d Kasich joked .\nKasich almost never travels with his wife , Karen , and 16-year-old twin daughters , Reese and Emma . He says he wants to be careful how much exposure the twins receive .\nAnd although he has women working on his campaign \u2014 his campaign manager is Beth Hansen , his former gubernatorial chief of staff \u2014 his traveling staff and advisers are all men .\n\u201c Sometimes this bus is like being in a fraternity house , you know ? \u201d Kasich said in the interview . \u201c I would rather have a situation where we could bring more women in , but on this bus , it \u2019 s just guys , you know ?

        "content_original": "CLOSE\n\nJohn Kasich speaks at a town hall in Nashua, N.H., on Jan. 23, 2016. (Photo: Darren McCollester, Getty Images)\n\nJohn Kasich was killing it with these Iowa voters.\n\nHe bantered with Larry, a Coralville voter, about the University of Iowa's hot hoops team. Iowa had better take advantage of Ohio State University, he said. \"Our basketball team is down this year.\"\n\nKasich\u2019s signature down-home small talk over, Larry asked the Republican presidential candidate if he supports the Renewable Fuel Standard\u2019s requirement that gas contain a certain amount of ethanol, much of it made from Iowa corn. Kasich supports the existing law.\n\n\u201cYou keep going,\u201d Larry told Kasich, calling him \"Johnny.\" \u201cIf you\u2019re ever in the great state of Iowa and you\u2019re close, we\u2019ll come and wave to ya.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right: Kasich was talking to Larry, and more than 12,000 other Iowa voters, in a telephone town-hall meeting Thursday night. Kasich was calling from the other early-voting state: New Hampshire.\n\nNot here for caucuses\n\nKasich is polling at just less than 3% in Iowa ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses, putting him in ninth, according to the RealClearPolitics rolling average of recent polls. Talk among the Kasich team of a possible top-five finish has faded.\n\nWhile other candidates have swarmed Iowa this month, Kasich has appeared just twice: Jan. 4 in West Des Moines and Jan. 10 in Council Bluffs. He plans Iowa visits this week in the Quad Cities, Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, but he's not scheduled to be in Iowa on caucus day.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s taking his town-hall game in person to New Hampshire. Ahead of the Feb. 9 primary, he's in a tight battle with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for second place. Finishing just behind poll-leading Donald Trump, he hopes, could propel him to prominence among establishment Republicans leery of Trump and Cruz, who are topping national surveys.\n\nHis approach, Kasich and his advisers say, has its roots in reality: It\u2019s next to impossible to win both contests, so they're focusing on the state where they have the best shot. The same candidate has won both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary only once in the last seven contested GOP elections: 1976, the first year Iowa Republicans kicked off the nation\u2019s voting.\n\n\u201cI wish I had more time for Iowa,\u201d Kasich said in an interview Wednesday on his campaign bus in New Hampshire. \u201cWhen we go, we get such good response, so it\u2019s tempting to keep going back. It\u2019s time management. It\u2019s nothing against the folks in Iowa.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa tele-town halls \u2014 Kasich has held three \u2014 have helped some. On Thursday night, people dropped in and out of the conversation, with as many as 4,375 participants at any time, data from the vendor show. The average participant spent a whopping 32 minutes on the hour-long call, up from 15 minutes and eight minutes in the previous calls. Some Iowans, at least, are interested in Kasich.\n\nHe told participants on the phone call that he\u2019d appreciate any boost he can get from their caucus votes.\n\nWhat about caucusgoers who worry about \u201cthrowing away\u201d their votes on a low-polling candidate?\n\n\u201cI vote for the person that I like. I don\u2019t worry about throwing away my vote. I vote for the person who can do a good job,\u201d Kasich said in the interview.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich campaigns in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Jan. 10, 2016. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP)\n\n'Bursting to tell them'\n\nIn the tele-town halls, Iowans get a taste of the same Kasich they\u2019d see in person \u2014 minus the teal puffy coat he\u2019s been wearing this winter, the national debt ticker that decorates his town-hall meetings and the blue bus carting him through the New Hampshire snow.\n\nWith Kasich, voters get an hour of folksy explanations of complicated policies, plus exhortations to take care of each other, seek a personal purpose, become part of something bigger than themselves.\n\nHe also makes jokes that make fun of audience members, or himself, or the presidential process. He drops names. (He\u2019s friends with John McCain, who twice won the New Hampshire primaries. He got Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s autograph for his daughters at a restaurant this month.)\n\nHe sometimes interrupts questioners or finishes their queries for them.\n\n\u201cMy mind works very fast, you know, and there\u2019s things that they say that trigger something that I can\u2019t wait to tell them,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019m really not trying to cut anybody off, and I\u2019m certainly not trying to show them any disrespect, but \u2014 can\u2019t we just kind of get to it? I\u2019m just bursting to tell them.\u201d\n\nRushad Thomas walked right into a Kasich joke Monday night at a town hall in Lebanon, New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI think immigration is a good thing, because our population is getting very old-people heavy,\u201d Thomas, 26, said to the audience, which was also very \u201cold-people heavy,\u201d since the event was at a senior center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re not running for president,\u201d Kasich joked.\n\nThen, Thomas launched into his question:\n\n\u201cThe Clean Power Plan, of Obama \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m against it,\u201d Kasich interrupted.\n\nBoys on the bus\n\nKasich almost never travels with his wife, Karen, and 16-year-old twin daughters, Reese and Emma. He says he wants to be careful how much exposure the twins receive.\n\nAnd although he has women working on his campaign \u2014 his campaign manager is Beth Hansen, his former gubernatorial chief of staff \u2014 his traveling staff and advisers are all men.\n\n\u201cSometimes this bus is like being in a fraternity house, you know?\u201d Kasich said in the interview. \u201cI would rather have a situation where we could bring more women in, but on this bus, it\u2019s just guys, you know? It\u2019s not ideal. But there\u2019s only a couple of people that I talk to really, really seriously, and Beth is one of them.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s family joined him Monday and Tuesday in New Hampshire. His daughters told voters Kasich was the most loving, caring and experienced GOP candidate \u2014 and \u201cthe only one I\u2019d feel comfortable with,\u201d Reese said.\n\nOnce, in Lebanon, Kasich teased Reese for wanting to attend college at an art school in London.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of school is that?\u201d he said, to chuckles. After some back and forth, she finally agreed to give him a hug. \u201cIf I was making fun of you, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t. We all need to laugh at ourselves.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his finest parenting moment. So he did what parents do. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like that, and I actually had to apologize to her,\u201d he said in the interview.\n\nWithout his daughters on the campaign trail, Kasich lights up whenever he sees a child. He read a Thomas the Tank Engine book to a family of toddlers in the middle of a town-hall meeting, asking the children what noise a cow makes.\n\nFinally, he supplied, in a shaky voice: \u201cMoo!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said it like a goat!\u201d a voter shouted.\n\nNew Hampshire voters who see Kasich often say they believe he\u2019ll \u201cget things done\u201d in Washington, D.C. They cite his down-home style and his blue-collar upbringing.\n\nCampaign signs for John Kasich are seen at a campaign stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa. (Photo: Jae C.

He\u2019s going to be up there in the top three by the end.\u201d\n\nOn the tele-town hall Thursday, political director Jeff Polesovsky asked the Iowa callers: Would you consider caucusing for Kasich?\n\nPress 1, he said, if he\u2019s your first choice. Press 2 to say I\u2019m considering him. Press 3 for no. Press 4 if you\u2019re undecided.\n\n\u201cHow about 5 for: \u2018What, are you out of your mind?\u2019 \u201d Kasich cracked. \u201cYou gotta have a little fun, folks.

        "content": "Who Gets The Blame For The Romney Loss ? The Tea Party Has A Theory .\nIt was an election that , once upon a time , many thought was stacked in Mitt Romney 's favor .\nUnemployment was hovering around eight percent , a number that was much higher in black and Latino households . Many had simply given up and stopped looking for work , pessimistic about the future . Voters were still skeptical or fearful about President Obama 's health care plan , and small business owners were bracing for what they thought would be higher costs . Overseas , a civil war raging unabated in Syria , resulting in the deaths of thousands , was threatening to upend the entire Middle East .\nAnd yet Romney did n't win . The popular vote count was pretty close : 50.5 percent for Obama , 48 percent for Romney . Almost , but not quite , a split down the middle . The two-point-plus spread made it the fifth closest presidential election in more than a century \u2014 trailing only Kennedy-Nixon 1960 , Bush-Gore 2000 , Nixon-Humphrey 1968 and Carter-Ford 1976 .\nBut it was n't close in the Electoral College . With Florida now finally called , Obama finished with 332 electoral votes \u2014 62 more than the 270 needed to put him over the top . ( Romney received 206 . ) Three hundred thirty-two electoral votes may not be something to write home about ( it 's 33 fewer than what he got four years ago ) , but it 's more than any Republican got since George H.W . Bush in 1988 . And think of all that transfixed us in the days and weeks leading up to Nov. 6 , those elusive and hard-to-predict `` battleground states . '' With the exception of North Carolina , Obama carried every single one : Nevada , Colorado , Iowa , Wisconsin , Ohio , New Hampshire , Virginia and Florida .\nAnd what accounts for this result ? According to leaders of the Tea Party and others on the right , the reason why the GOP suffered on Nov. 6 is because Romney was too moderate .\nIn a Washington news conference the day after the election , longtime conservative activist Richard Viguerie argued that Romney had no core conservative principles , and flatly stated , `` The battle to take over the Republican Party begins today . ''\nThe Los Angeles Times ' Robin Abcarian writes that Viguerie called for the resignation of the entire GOP leadership for its `` epic election failure of 2012 . '' He singled out RNC chair Reince Priebus , House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell . And that was n't all :\n`` In any logical universe , '' Viguerie said , `` establishment Republican consultants such as Karl Rove , Ed Gillespie and Romney campaign senior advisors Stuart Stevens and Neil Newhouse would never be hired to run or consult on a national campaign again and no one would give a dime to their ineffective 'super PACs . ' ''\nAlso attending the news conference was Jenny Beth Martin , the national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots . Like Viguerie , she was n't happy :\n`` What we got was a weak moderate candidate handpicked by the Beltway elites and country-club establishment wing of the Republican Party . The presidential loss is unequivocally on them , '' she said .\nNot everyone on the right buys that argument . According to Abcarian 's article , conservative columnist Michael Barone `` told an audience at Hillsdale College 's center in Washington that the tea party , while bringing some talented politicians to the fore , also brought some 'wackos and weirdos and witches . ' '' Barone singled out Todd Akin , the unsuccessful GOP Senate candidate in Missouri , and Richard Mourdock , who performed the same role in Indiana .\nIt 's always been a two-edged sword in assessing the role played by the Tea Party in Republican victories and defeats . The movement was undeniably significant in the GOP 's House takeover in 2010 , responsible as much as anyone for the Republican pickup of 63 seats . But it may have also cost the party the Senate as well that year , as weak and/or flawed Tea Party candidates in states such as Nevada ( Sharron Angle ) and Delaware ( Christine O'Donnell ) turned likely Republican victories into crushing defeats .\nIndiana 's Mourdock , who trounced longtime GOP Sen. Dick Lugar in this year 's May primary , never got his footing with moderates and independents . After beating Lugar , he said he would model himself after South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint , a Tea Party favorite . He promised to be `` confrontational '' on key issues . And , in a direct slap at Lugar 's reputation for working out deals with Democrats , Mourdock said , `` I do n't think there 's going to be a lot of successful compromise . I hope to build a conservative majority in the U.S. Senate so bipartisanship becomes Democrats joining Republicans to roll back the size of government . '' Mourdock lost to Democrat Joe Donnelly .\nNor did Missouri 's Akin go into the general election talking compromise . A no-nonsense conservative , he helped save the career of vulnerable Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill by getting embroiled in a controversy over `` legitimate rape '' and pregnancy . His comments \u2014 along with those of Mourdock and a few others \u2014 became Democratic talking points throughout the country , resulting in a huge night for Democratic women . Akin himself was buried in a landslide .\nBut it would be a mistake to pin the defeats of 6 November on the Tea Party . In Wisconsin , former four term Gov . Tommy Thompson defeated Tea Party opposition during the GOP primary and then promptly lost in the general election to Rep. Tammy Baldwin , a strong liberal . Conservatives insist that a candidate with better right-wing bona fides would have won . In New Mexico , ex-Rep. Heather Wilson ( R ) touted her moderate credentials but she got crushed by Democrat Martin Heinrich in the battle for an open Senate seat . And no one can blame the defeat of Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts on the Tea Partiers . ( Though if Brown lost because of the weight of Obama strength in the commonwealth , how do you explain the victories of Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota or Sen. Jon Tester in Montana , two states that Romney carried handily ? )\nIt was also a mixed scorecard for the Tea Party in the House . Some , like Allen West in Florida , found that their penchant for controversy may have cost them their seats ( West trails Democrat Patrick Murphy by 1,907 votes but refuses to concede ) . Others , like Michele Bachmann in Minnesota , escaped by the barest of margins .\nBut the Republican Party kept their majority and may have held their net losses to single digits . Many Tea Party candidates won re-election and lived to fight another day \u2014 a surprise to some , given that there was talk about 2012 being a `` correction '' from the 2010 Republican tsunami . Many of the GOP defeats came as a result of redistricting , not a backlash to the Tea Party . In Illinois , Democrats were in complete control of redrawing the lines and promptly defeated Reps. Joe Walsh , Robert Dold , Judy Biggert and Bobby Schilling ( though , in fairness , the controversial Walsh , a Tea Party favorite , was probably doomed no matter how his district was drawn ) . In California , new district lines certainly helped push Raul Ruiz over Rep. Mary Bono Mack ( R ) in the 36th CD .

        "content_original": "Who Gets The Blame For The Romney Loss? The Tea Party Has A Theory.\n\nIt was an election that, once upon a time, many thought was stacked in Mitt Romney's favor.\n\nUnemployment was hovering around eight percent, a number that was much higher in black and Latino households. Many had simply given up and stopped looking for work, pessimistic about the future. Voters were still skeptical or fearful about President Obama's health care plan, and small business owners were bracing for what they thought would be higher costs. Overseas, a civil war raging unabated in Syria, resulting in the deaths of thousands, was threatening to upend the entire Middle East.\n\nAnd yet Romney didn't win. The popular vote count was pretty close: 50.5 percent for Obama, 48 percent for Romney. Almost, but not quite, a split down the middle. The two-point-plus spread made it the fifth closest presidential election in more than a century \u2014 trailing only Kennedy-Nixon 1960, Bush-Gore 2000, Nixon-Humphrey 1968 and Carter-Ford 1976.\n\nBut it wasn't close in the Electoral College. With Florida now finally called, Obama finished with 332 electoral votes \u2014 62 more than the 270 needed to put him over the top. (Romney received 206.) Three hundred thirty-two electoral votes may not be something to write home about (it's 33 fewer than what he got four years ago), but it's more than any Republican got since George H.W. Bush in 1988. And think of all that transfixed us in the days and weeks leading up to Nov. 6, those elusive and hard-to-predict \"battleground states.\" With the exception of North Carolina, Obama carried every single one: Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia and Florida.\n\nAnd what accounts for this result? According to leaders of the Tea Party and others on the right, the reason why the GOP suffered on Nov. 6 is because Romney was too moderate.\n\ntoggle caption Ken Rudin collection\n\nIn a Washington news conference the day after the election, longtime conservative activist Richard Viguerie argued that Romney had no core conservative principles, and flatly stated, \"The battle to take over the Republican Party begins today.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times' Robin Abcarian writes that Viguerie called for the resignation of the entire GOP leadership for its \"epic election failure of 2012.\" He singled out RNC chair Reince Priebus, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. And that wasn't all:\n\n\"In any logical universe,\" Viguerie said, \"establishment Republican consultants such as Karl Rove, Ed Gillespie and Romney campaign senior advisors Stuart Stevens and Neil Newhouse would never be hired to run or consult on a national campaign again and no one would give a dime to their ineffective 'super PACs.'\"\n\nAlso attending the news conference was Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots. Like Viguerie, she wasn't happy:\n\n\"What we got was a weak moderate candidate handpicked by the Beltway elites and country-club establishment wing of the Republican Party. The presidential loss is unequivocally on them,\" she said.\n\nNot everyone on the right buys that argument. According to Abcarian's article, conservative columnist Michael Barone \"told an audience at Hillsdale College's center in Washington that the tea party, while bringing some talented politicians to the fore, also brought some 'wackos and weirdos and witches.'\" Barone singled out Todd Akin, the unsuccessful GOP Senate candidate in Missouri, and Richard Mourdock, who performed the same role in Indiana.\n\nIt's always been a two-edged sword in assessing the role played by the Tea Party in Republican victories and defeats. The movement was undeniably significant in the GOP's House takeover in 2010, responsible as much as anyone for the Republican pickup of 63 seats. But it may have also cost the party the Senate as well that year, as weak and/or flawed Tea Party candidates in states such as Nevada (Sharron Angle) and Delaware (Christine O'Donnell) turned likely Republican victories into crushing defeats.\n\ntoggle caption Ken Rudin collection\n\nIndiana's Mourdock, who trounced longtime GOP Sen. Dick Lugar in this year's May primary, never got his footing with moderates and independents. After beating Lugar, he said he would model himself after South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, a Tea Party favorite. He promised to be \"confrontational\" on key issues. And, in a direct slap at Lugar's reputation for working out deals with Democrats, Mourdock said, \"I don't think there's going to be a lot of successful compromise. I hope to build a conservative majority in the U.S. Senate so bipartisanship becomes Democrats joining Republicans to roll back the size of government.\" Mourdock lost to Democrat Joe Donnelly.\n\nNor did Missouri's Akin go into the general election talking compromise. A no-nonsense conservative, he helped save the career of vulnerable Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill by getting embroiled in a controversy over \"legitimate rape\" and pregnancy. His comments \u2014 along with those of Mourdock and a few others \u2014 became Democratic talking points throughout the country, resulting in a huge night for Democratic women. Akin himself was buried in a landslide.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to pin the defeats of 6 November on the Tea Party. In Wisconsin, former four term Gov. Tommy Thompson defeated Tea Party opposition during the GOP primary and then promptly lost in the general election to Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a strong liberal. Conservatives insist that a candidate with better right-wing bona fides would have won. In New Mexico, ex-Rep. Heather Wilson (R) touted her moderate credentials but she got crushed by Democrat Martin Heinrich in the battle for an open Senate seat. And no one can blame the defeat of Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts on the Tea Partiers. (Though if Brown lost because of the weight of Obama strength in the commonwealth, how do you explain the victories of Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota or Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, two states that Romney carried handily?)\n\nIt was also a mixed scorecard for the Tea Party in the House. Some, like Allen West in Florida, found that their penchant for controversy may have cost them their seats (West trails Democrat Patrick Murphy by 1,907 votes but refuses to concede). Others, like Michele Bachmann in Minnesota, escaped by the barest of margins.\n\nBut the Republican Party kept their majority and may have held their net losses to single digits. Many Tea Party candidates won re-election and lived to fight another day \u2014 a surprise to some, given that there was talk about 2012 being a \"correction\" from the 2010 Republican tsunami. Many of the GOP defeats came as a result of redistricting, not a backlash to the Tea Party. In Illinois, Democrats were in complete control of redrawing the lines and promptly defeated Reps. Joe Walsh, Robert Dold, Judy Biggert and Bobby Schilling (though, in fairness, the controversial Walsh, a Tea Party favorite, was probably doomed no matter how his district was drawn). In California, new district lines certainly helped push Raul Ruiz over Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R) in the 36th CD. At this writing, two other California Republicans, Dan Lungren (7th CD) and Brian Bilbray (52nd CD), trail their Democratic opponents.\n\n(By the same token, Republican-controlled redistricting in North Carolina is probably responsible for the GOP adding three more seats to their total.)\n\nIn trying to determine what exactly happened to the Republican Party, focusing on the Tea Party may be missing the bigger point: the changing demographics of the country. Obama won women by 11 points. He took 71 percent of Latinos, 73 percent of Asians, 93 percent of blacks. Sixty percent of voters under 30. Once upon a time, winning the white vote by a 61-39 percentage \u2014 as Romney did \u2014 would be enough for victory. Those days may be gone.

(As yet, there isn\u2019t such evidence.)\n\nAmong the coalition\u2019s members are a range of conserviative medical and business groups, such as Americans for Fair Taxation, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, Young Americans Against Socialism and the Colorado Business Roundtable.\n\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nAs lawmakers and the administration negotiated a huge rescue package to stand up the U.S. economy, JCN\u2019s president, Alfredo Ortiz, told Bloomberg News that he\u2019d had three direct calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week about the administration\u2019s plan.\n\nAmong the group\u2019s ideas, Ortiz told Bloomberg, was to extend quarterly April tax payments by two or three months, a move that would allow businesses to defer paying some 2020 taxes as well as taxes owed in 2019. He also said he discussed with Mnuchin a plan to streamline Small Business Administration loans.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, Breitbart News co-founder and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon said that \u201cBernie Marcus\u2019 Job Creators Network has a plan of forcing cash into the system.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate on it.\n\nJob Creators Network paid Breitbart News Network $1.1 million for advertising in 2018, according to the group\u2019s 990 tax form from that year, the most recent publicly available. The news outlet wrote last week that JCN had launched an ad campaign airing on Fox to advocate for its members.\n\nMarcus is a generous donor to Republican groups and causes. During the 2016 presidential campaign he gave $5 million to a pro-Trump PAC and has said he\u2019ll support the president\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, tax filings and campaign disclosure reports show, JCN gave $213,000 to the American Potential Fund, a political action committee that spent most of that sum on digital ads targeting then-incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida during the last month of the election. Nelson, a Democrat, was defeated by Republican Rick Scott in a tight race.\n\nTell Us More About Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert?

        "content": "Dated but relevant : \u201c From the moment he took office , Trump communicated to everyone that they were there to serve him and him alone . He forced White House staff to sign nondisclosure agreements . James Comey testified that in the first days of Trump \u2019 s presidency , he called the FBI director to the White House and told him , \u2018 I need loyalty , I expect loyalty. \u2019 \u2026 \u201c No president has ever asked for more loyalty or gotten less ; even as he demands the most abject displays of sycophancy as a demonstration of his people \u2019 s commitment to him , Trump \u2019 s White House is populated by backstabbers and schemers who for years have provided reporters with a steady stream of anonymous leaks and gossip portraying him as an incompetent fool\u2026 \u201c You may have noticed that there were no scandalous insider tell-alls written about Barack Obama , and it wasn \u2019 t because he rooted out internal enemies and punished those whose faith in him wavered . The loyalty he got from those who worked for him was earned , not demanded . So perhaps what we should want is politicians who don \u2019 t value loyalty , who ask from their staff only hard work , competence , commitment to the public interest , and principle . Imagine what that might be like. \u201d Paul Waldman , Washington Post\n\u201c Tuberville \u2019 s football past could play a surprisingly big part in November \u2019 s general election . Though he gained national attention for leading the Auburn Tigers to an undefeated season in 2004 , five years earlier he handed down a one-game suspension to a player who was charged with the second-degree rape of a 15-year-old girl . Despite the player pleading guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor , Tuberville permitted the player to remain on the team\u2026 Whether he \u2019 ll serve his team well in November remains to be seen. \u201d Jane Coaston , Vox\n\u201c It \u2019 s a little weird contemplating Sessions now . Trump \u2019 s treatment of him was outrageous , but if anybody \u2019 s going to suffer a political stab in the back , you have to be glad it \u2019 s the guy whose policies as attorney general ranged from keeping more people in prison longer to \u2018 good people don \u2019 t smoke marijuana. \u2019 Tommy Tuberville , the football coach who beat Sessions , doesn \u2019 t seem to have any ideas beyond flexing his muscles and promising to do whatever President Trump likes . Alabamians have no idea what he would do if Joe Biden was president , since Tuberville will never acknowledge such a possibility. \u201d Gail Collins , New York Times\n\u201c As I wrote in June , to ditch Trump now would be a futile effort for most Senate Republicans . Which voters are they going to win over ? There is no political home for Republicans in office who want to leave the president . Sessions was an extreme example of that , because he tried to launch a political comeback from one of the most pro-Trump states in the nation while being on Trump \u2019 s bad side . But there are other cautionary tales from the Senate\u2026 \u201c Jeff Flake in Arizona and Bob Corker in Tennessee both prominently criticized Trump while in office , and it played a role in both of them deciding not to run for reelection . One conservative congressman from South Carolina lost his primary after criticizing Trump and said the president \u2019 s tweets played a role . Republicans are trying to hang on to their Senate majority , and the last thing they need is a Sessions-like battle with the president who deems some of them not loyal enough .

        "content_original": "Dated but relevant: \u201cFrom the moment he took office, Trump communicated to everyone that they were there to serve him and him alone. He forced White House staff to sign nondisclosure agreements. James Comey testified that in the first days of Trump\u2019s presidency, he called the FBI director to the White House and told him, \u2018I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.\u2019\u2026 \u201cNo president has ever asked for more loyalty or gotten less; even as he demands the most abject displays of sycophancy as a demonstration of his people\u2019s commitment to him, Trump\u2019s White House is populated by backstabbers and schemers who for years have provided reporters with a steady stream of anonymous leaks and gossip portraying him as an incompetent fool\u2026 \u201c You may have noticed that there were no scandalous insider tell-alls written about Barack Obama , and it wasn\u2019t because he rooted out internal enemies and punished those whose faith in him wavered. The loyalty he got from those who worked for him was earned, not demanded. So perhaps what we should want is politicians who don\u2019t value loyalty, who ask from their staff only hard work, competence, commitment to the public interest, and principle. Imagine what that might be like.\u201d Paul Waldman, Washington Post\n\n\u201c Tuberville\u2019s football past could play a surprisingly big part in November\u2019s general election . Though he gained national attention for leading the Auburn Tigers to an undefeated season in 2004, five years earlier he handed down a one-game suspension to a player who was charged with the second-degree rape of a 15-year-old girl. Despite the player pleading guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor, Tuberville permitted the player to remain on the team\u2026 Whether he\u2019ll serve his team well in November remains to be seen.\u201d Jane Coaston, Vox\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little weird contemplating Sessions now. Trump\u2019s treatment of him was outrageous, but if anybody\u2019s going to suffer a political stab in the back, you have to be glad it\u2019s the guy whose policies as attorney general ranged from keeping more people in prison longer to \u2018good people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u2019 Tommy Tuberville, the football coach who beat Sessions, doesn\u2019t seem to have any ideas beyond flexing his muscles and promising to do whatever President Trump likes . Alabamians have no idea what he would do if Joe Biden was president, since Tuberville will never acknowledge such a possibility.\u201d Gail Collins, New York Times\n\n\u201cAs I wrote in June, to ditch Trump now would be a futile effort for most Senate Republicans. Which voters are they going to win over? There is no political home for Republicans in office who want to leave the president . Sessions was an extreme example of that, because he tried to launch a political comeback from one of the most pro-Trump states in the nation while being on Trump\u2019s bad side. But there are other cautionary tales from the Senate\u2026 \u201cJeff Flake in Arizona and Bob Corker in Tennessee both prominently criticized Trump while in office, and it played a role in both of them deciding not to run for reelection. One conservative congressman from South Carolina lost his primary after criticizing Trump and said the president\u2019s tweets played a role. Republicans are trying to hang on to their Senate majority, and the last thing they need is a Sessions-like battle with the president who deems some of them not loyal enough. That\u2019s a lesson many of them have already learned, but Sessions\u2019s humiliating defeat drives it home.\u201d Amber Phillips, Washington Post\n\n\u201cDuring the first half of Trump\u2019s term, Sessions was arguably the President\u2019s most effective Cabinet member, separating families at the border, removing federal oversight of dysfunctional police departments, holding back the Washington consensus on criminal-justice reform, getting out of the way of Republican-led states that wanted to restrict voting and to gerrymander their maps.\u2026 \u201c[But] In March, 2017, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation.

        "content": "A while back , hackers linked to the Russian government stole a cache of emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and furnished them to WikiLeaks . One of those emails has generated a lot of interest in conservative circles because \u2014 conservatives say \u2014 it shows that polls are being systematically biased in Clinton 's favor . In the email , Thomas Matzzie , an operative for the 2008 Clinton primary campaign , asked advisers at a progressive group called the Atlas Project to `` recommend oversamples for our polling . '' Bloggers like Zero Hedge and Gateway Pundit pounced on this as evidence that the Clinton campaign was working with mainstream media organizations to rig public polls in Clinton 's favor . That would be a big story if it were true . But as I 'll explain below , it 's not \u2014 people were misinterpreting a banal discussion about the campaign 's internal polling . More from Vox :\nDonald Trump 's bizarre hotel opening proved he 's in this for himself\nTrump booster Alex Jones : I 'm not anti-Semitic , but Jews run an evil conspiracy\nNewt Gingrich 's fight with Megyn Kelly reveals a gross , twisted logic about sexual assault\nBut even though the story is obviously , comically , wrong , it wo n't die . It 's been circulating for days among conservative blogs and social media accounts since it became public . And its longevity points to a troubling development in our media environment . Social media sites like Facebook have democratized the media landscape , allowing anyone to create and distribute content to their friends and family . There are a lot of good things about this , but it 's also proving to have a serious downside : Without the quality filters traditionally supplied by mainstream media outlets , there 's a lot more room for total nonsense to circulate widely . The increasing polarization of news through social media allows liberals and conservatives to live in different versions of reality . And that 's making it harder and harder for our democratic system to function .\nThe Washington Post 's Philip Bump has a thorough debunking of the conspiracy theory about `` oversampling . '' But to summarize , there are at least three reasons experienced reporters knew the story made no sense : Oversampling is n't a nefarious tactic for manipulating poll results . It 's a standard technique for collecting extra data about a particular group ( Hispanics or millennials , for example ) to enable more detailed analysis of that group . Pollsters automatically re-weight the members of the oversampled group to ensure the overall result is n't skewed .\nThe email was about internal polls being conducted on behalf of Clinton 's 2008 primary campaign to guide campaign strategy . They were n't intended for release to the public . Manipulating these polls would have only hurt the Clinton campaign .\nThe email was written in January 2008 . So if there were a conspiracy to rig polls in favor of Democrats , it would have shown up in poll results in the 2008 and 2012 general elections . Yet that did n't happen . Polling averages got the final margin almost exactly in 2008 ( missing by only 0.3 percent in the RealClearPolitics average ) , and in 2012 they actually underestimated Obama 's final margin by about 3 points .\nOn the other hand , if you 're an ordinary Trump supporter scrolling through your Facebook feed , none of this would necessarily be obvious . In that case , you 've probably never heard of oversampling , you do n't know that campaigns run internal polls , and you might not notice that the email was from 2008 rather than 2016 . And so if someone shares a Facebook post arguing that the email shows the Clinton campaign is rigging public polls \u2014 and that this explains why Trump is behind in the polls even though most of your friends support Trump \u2014 you 're going to be inclined to believe it . And you might even share it with your friends . So this conspiracy theory has rocketed around the conservative internet , passing from one conservative Facebook user to another . Its spread has been amplified by aggregators like Matt Drudge , who is happy to direct viewers to juicy stories without worrying too much about whether they 're true .\nThis is n't just the fault of online media . Even before the advent of Facebook and Twitter , partisan media platforms like talk radio and Fox News sometimes prooted conspiratorial stories with little evidence to back them up . But it 's a problem that social media is now making much worse . The Washington Post and other mainstream media organizations have written stories explaining why the `` oversampling '' conspiracy theory is wrong . But because these stories challenge conservatives ' biases instead of confirming them , they 're much less likely to get traction among conservatives on social media . The key thing to note about this process is that it 's not apparent to the average Facebook user . When people opened a traditional newspaper , they got a representative sample of the previous day 's news . They also got stories that had been written by professional reporters who had at least a passing familiarity with the stories they were writing about . So obvious nonsense like this rigged polling story would n't have shown up in the news . The Facebook newsfeed is n't like that . It 's a sampling of stories heavily skewed toward the kinds of stories your friends and family like to share . And many stories are produced by amateurs with no real expertise in the topics they write about . So stories that are inaccurate but confirm people 's biases ( like `` the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media are conspiring to rig the polls '' ) are more likely to show up in people 's Facebook feeds than stories that reach an accurate but banal conclusion on the same subject . The result : Partisans can feel like they 're very well informed on a particular subject because they 've read dozens of stories about it . What they often do n't realize is that thanks to social media 's filter bubble , they 're only hearing stories from one side \u2014 and that these one-sided stories may all be based on the same mistaken reasoning or may all be ignoring the same inconvenient evidence .\nSo far I 've focused on a particular conspiracy theory that 's in vogue among Trump supporters . But a similar dynamic can be found on the political left . When I last wrote about this topic back in March , I described how supporters of Bernie Sanders had found themselves trapped in a similar kind of filter bubble . Reddit is a popular news aggregator in which users vote about which stories to promote to the front page . And by March of this year , the politics section of the site had become dominated by Bernie Sanders supporters . As a result , if you relied on Reddit for your political news this spring , you basically only saw stories that praised Sanders and criticized Clinton and the Republican candidates :\nThe front page of Reddit 's /r/politics section in March 2016\nSanders supporters did n't just read a lot of pro-Sanders opinion pieces \u2014 they wound up living in a different factual universe . As Clinton consolidated her lead in the primary campaign , Sanders fans concocted increasingly far-fetched theories to explain why he could still win . And as it became clear he could n't win , Reddit and other social media helped to convince many Bernie fans that the Clinton campaign had stolen the election . That was n't true . The Democratic primary process is complex and probably has room for improvement , but the basic fact was that Clinton won the race because she had more supporters . Conspiratorial thinking has been less common among Clinton supporters , but they should n't be too smug about it . If the campaign had turned out differently \u2014 if Sanders had won the primary or Clinton were currently trailing Trump in the polls \u2014 we likely would have seen the same kind of anger and paranoia among Clinton 's most hardcore supporters .\nFilter bubbles are a long-term danger to our political system",

In the email, Thomas Matzzie, an operative for the 2008 Clinton primary campaign, asked advisers at a progressive group called the Atlas Project to \"recommend oversamples for our polling.\" Bloggers like Zero Hedge and Gateway Pundit pounced on this as evidence that the Clinton campaign was working with mainstream media organizations to rig public polls in Clinton's favor. That would be a big story if it were true. But as I'll explain below, it's not \u2014 people were misinterpreting a banal discussion about the campaign's internal polling. More from Vox:\n\nDonald Trump's bizarre hotel opening proved he's in this for himself\n\nTrump booster Alex Jones: I'm not anti-Semitic, but Jews run an evil conspiracy\n\nNewt Gingrich's fight with Megyn Kelly reveals a gross, twisted logic about sexual assault\n\nBut even though the story is obviously, comically, wrong, it won't die. It's been circulating for days among conservative blogs and social media accounts since it became public. And its longevity points to a troubling development in our media environment. Social media sites like Facebook have democratized the media landscape, allowing anyone to create and distribute content to their friends and family. There are a lot of good things about this, but it's also proving to have a serious downside: Without the quality filters traditionally supplied by mainstream media outlets, there's a lot more room for total nonsense to circulate widely. The increasing polarization of news through social media allows liberals and conservatives to live in different versions of reality. And that's making it harder and harder for our democratic system to function.\n\nWhy nonsense stories spread so quickly on social media\n\nThe Washington Post's Philip Bump has a thorough debunking of the conspiracy theory about \"oversampling.\" But to summarize, there are at least three reasons experienced reporters knew the story made no sense: Oversampling isn't a nefarious tactic for manipulating poll results. It's a standard technique for collecting extra data about a particular group (Hispanics or millennials, for example) to enable more detailed analysis of that group. Pollsters automatically re-weight the members of the oversampled group to ensure the overall result isn't skewed.\n\n\n\nThe email was about internal polls being conducted on behalf of Clinton's 2008 primary campaign to guide campaign strategy. They weren't intended for release to the public. Manipulating these polls would have only hurt the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe email was written in January 2008. So if there were a conspiracy to rig polls in favor of Democrats, it would have shown up in poll results in the 2008 and 2012 general elections. Yet that didn't happen. Polling averages got the final margin almost exactly in 2008 (missing by only 0.3 percent in the RealClearPolitics average), and in 2012 they actually underestimated Obama's final margin by about 3 points.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're an ordinary Trump supporter scrolling through your Facebook feed, none of this would necessarily be obvious. In that case, you've probably never heard of oversampling, you don't know that campaigns run internal polls, and you might not notice that the email was from 2008 rather than 2016. And so if someone shares a Facebook post arguing that the email shows the Clinton campaign is rigging public polls \u2014 and that this explains why Trump is behind in the polls even though most of your friends support Trump \u2014 you're going to be inclined to believe it. And you might even share it with your friends. So this conspiracy theory has rocketed around the conservative internet, passing from one conservative Facebook user to another. Its spread has been amplified by aggregators like Matt Drudge, who is happy to direct viewers to juicy stories without worrying too much about whether they're true.\n\nSocial media distorts how partisans understand the world\n\nThis isn't just the fault of online media. Even before the advent of Facebook and Twitter, partisan media platforms like talk radio and Fox News sometimes prooted conspiratorial stories with little evidence to back them up. But it's a problem that social media is now making much worse. The Washington Post and other mainstream media organizations have written stories explaining why the \"oversampling\" conspiracy theory is wrong. But because these stories challenge conservatives' biases instead of confirming them, they're much less likely to get traction among conservatives on social media. The key thing to note about this process is that it's not apparent to the average Facebook user. When people opened a traditional newspaper, they got a representative sample of the previous day's news. They also got stories that had been written by professional reporters who had at least a passing familiarity with the stories they were writing about. So obvious nonsense like this rigged polling story wouldn't have shown up in the news. The Facebook newsfeed isn't like that. It's a sampling of stories heavily skewed toward the kinds of stories your friends and family like to share. And many stories are produced by amateurs with no real expertise in the topics they write about. So stories that are inaccurate but confirm people's biases (like \"the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media are conspiring to rig the polls\") are more likely to show up in people's Facebook feeds than stories that reach an accurate but banal conclusion on the same subject. The result: Partisans can feel like they're very well informed on a particular subject because they've read dozens of stories about it. What they often don't realize is that thanks to social media's filter bubble, they're only hearing stories from one side \u2014 and that these one-sided stories may all be based on the same mistaken reasoning or may all be ignoring the same inconvenient evidence.\n\nSocial media misinforms people across the political spectrum\n\nSo far I've focused on a particular conspiracy theory that's in vogue among Trump supporters. But a similar dynamic can be found on the political left. When I last wrote about this topic back in March, I described how supporters of Bernie Sanders had found themselves trapped in a similar kind of filter bubble. Reddit is a popular news aggregator in which users vote about which stories to promote to the front page. And by March of this year, the politics section of the site had become dominated by Bernie Sanders supporters. As a result, if you relied on Reddit for your political news this spring, you basically only saw stories that praised Sanders and criticized Clinton and the Republican candidates:\n\nThe front page of Reddit's /r/politics section in March 2016\n\nSanders supporters didn't just read a lot of pro-Sanders opinion pieces \u2014 they wound up living in a different factual universe. As Clinton consolidated her lead in the primary campaign, Sanders fans concocted increasingly far-fetched theories to explain why he could still win. And as it became clear he couldn't win, Reddit and other social media helped to convince many Bernie fans that the Clinton campaign had stolen the election. That wasn't true. The Democratic primary process is complex and probably has room for improvement, but the basic fact was that Clinton won the race because she had more supporters. Conspiratorial thinking has been less common among Clinton supporters, but they shouldn't be too smug about it. If the campaign had turned out differently \u2014 if Sanders had won the primary or Clinton were currently trailing Trump in the polls \u2014 we likely would have seen the same kind of anger and paranoia among Clinton's most hardcore supporters.\n\nFilter bubbles are a long-term danger to our political system",

        "content": "For President Obama and the press , the past year has been anything but a slobbering love affair .\nAfter the high point of his inauguration , I \u2019 d say Obama has gotten pretty rough coverage that fairly mirrors the rough passage of his fifth year in office . This has been capped by the last two months , with the ObamaCare fiasco dominating the coverage and casting doubt on the competence of the president and his team .\nEven the improvements made to the health care website hasn \u2019 t spared the Obama team fresh criticism that some of the information being submitted to insurance companies is inaccurate , which could leave many without coverage .\nAnd the lack of a significant domestic accomplishment leaves Obama \u2019 s defenders with few talking points . You know you \u2019 re having time when the only relief you get is talking to the Iranians about nukes ( and even that agreement is proving a tough sell on the Hill ) .\nNow , thanks to a journalistic convention , Obama is starting to get hit by a new wave of negative press . As we head into the Christmas season , the pundits are easing into their year-end wrap-ups , and are turning thumbs-down on the president \u2019 s tenure .\n\u201c By almost any measure , this has been a lost year for Obama on the domestic front , \u201d says the Washington Post \u2019 s Dan Balz . \u201c The flawed rollout of the health-care law , the most important initiative of his tenure , has been a huge setback . His main legislative efforts have either disappeared or are stalled . The economy continues to improve , but the fruits have been unevenly distributed . The government shutdown damaged the opposition , but the president \u2019 s ratings also are at record lows .\n\u201c This is hardly what Obama could have envisioned as he looked toward his second term in the weeks after his reelection . \u201d\nBalz is always measured in his judgments , so that amounts to a serious slam .\nChuck Todd and his co-authors at MSNBC echo the tone :\n\u201c It \u2019 s worth recapping how rough 2013 has been for President Obama . The struggles with the federal website ( more on that below ) have dominated the last two months , and have sent his approval ratings to new lows . But before that , it was the damaging NSA/Snowden leaks . Before that , it was the IRS-Benghazi-leak stories ( which have definitely lost their punch since the summer ) . And before that , it was the failure to get gun-control through the U.S. Senate . \u201d\nAnd Politico has this telling quote from GOP strategist Alex Castellanos about the impact on Hillary :\n\u201c Hillary Clinton is the life raft on Obama \u2019 s sinking ship : Obama \u2019 s troops would be a lot less likely to abandon ship if she wasn \u2019 t around . Hillary has to separate from Obama to win the general election but has to hug him close to win the nomination . If she leaves any room in the primaries between Obama and her own candidacy , she creates an opening for Elizabeth Warren . It \u2019 s going to be a tough call to figure out how close to hug the leper . \u201d\nSo according to this admittedly partisan analysis , the prospect of Hillary winning in 2016 is helping Barack in 2013 because she \u2019 s his former secretary of State .\nBut is it helping Hillary ? Another Politico piece\u2014this one about Chuck Hagel\u2014contains this revealing comment from a former Bill Clinton defense official who recently turned down a Pentagon job :\n\u201c To some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect . Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration , when you can make $ 300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary ? \u201d\nBecause she might not win ? Besides , Obama still has three years to go . And National Journal \u2019 s Ron Fournier , who has been harping on Obama \u2019 s lack of leadership , says :\n\u201c President Obama needs to fire himself . Not literally , of course , but practically : He needs to shake up his team so thoroughly that the new blood imposes change on how he manages the federal bureaucracy and leads .\n\u201c A series of self-inflicted wounds during his fifth year in office , capped by the botched launch of the Affordable Care Act , have Americans questioning the president 's competence and credibility . \u201d\nWe \u2019 ll give the final word to First Read , with its inevitable Chuck Todd college football reference :\n\u201c But here \u2019 s the thing about politics : It can change in the blink of an eye . Who \u2019 s up can go down ; who \u2019 s down can go up . And as we found out on Saturday , someone can run back a missed field goal kick 108 yards for an improbable come-from-behind victory . \u201d\nIf the odds of the president bouncing back are the same as that crazy play that won Auburn the game , he \u2019 s in trouble .\nThe New York Times \u2019 decision to illustrate a story about breast cancer in Israel with a front-page photo of a victim \u2019 s breasts , with a partially exposed nipple , has kicked up quite a debate . I said on \u201c Media Buzz \u201d that I thought the picture went too far and seemed a provocative departure for the Gray Lady .\nNow the unnamed 28-year-old has put out a statement , carried by Public Editor Margaret Sullivan :\n\u201c When I first saw the photo I did not find it either provocative or inappropriate . I thought it was powerful and told my story \u2013 I am a proud , young Jewish woman who had breast cancer , and I have a scar that proves it .\n\u201c I am not ashamed or embarrassed by the scar . Most of my breast was not exposed and the small part that was does not make the picture \u2018 cheap. \u2019 I think it \u2019 s very artistic .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t expect such controversy around the photo \u2013 but I \u2019 m glad the photo caused an impact since I believe that there should be more awareness about breast cancer , genetic testing , the conflict of \u2018 what to do \u2019 with a positive result , etc .\n\u201c I agreed to publish the photo since I wanted to raise awareness , but I decided to leave my identity unknown because I didn \u2019 t want to become famous because I had cancer . The cancer I fought this past year is a part of me , but it \u2019 s not who I am . It \u2019 s not me . In addition , this photo was taken spontaneously and I didn \u2019 t consult my close family beforehand , so I preferred to stay unknown .\n\u201c In response to some readers \u2019 comment on the tattoo I have on my body , I come from a family of Holocaust survivors . \u201d\nWhatever the journalistic propriety of the decision , I \u2019 m glad to get the perspective of the woman involved .\nAnd what is the lead anecdote showing that after one entire month in office , the New Jersey senator is keeping a low profile ?\nAfter coming off the floor on the vote to change the filibuster rule , he blew off a Politico reporter : \u201c I got a lot of thoughts , but I \u2019 m not going to share them right now . \u201d",

And before that, it was the failure to get gun-control through the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nNot much for the highlight reel there.\n\nAnd Politico has this telling quote from GOP strategist Alex Castellanos about the impact on Hillary:\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is the life raft on Obama\u2019s sinking ship: Obama\u2019s troops would be a lot less likely to abandon ship if she wasn\u2019t around. Hillary has to separate from Obama to win the general election but has to hug him close to win the nomination. If she leaves any room in the primaries between Obama and her own candidacy, she creates an opening for Elizabeth Warren. It\u2019s going to be a tough call to figure out how close to hug the leper.\u201d\n\nThe leper??\n\nSo according to this admittedly partisan analysis, the prospect of Hillary winning in 2016 is helping Barack in 2013 because she\u2019s his former secretary of State.\n\nBut is it helping Hillary? Another Politico piece\u2014this one about Chuck Hagel\u2014contains this revealing comment from a former Bill Clinton defense official who recently turned down a Pentagon job:\n\n\u201cTo some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect. Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration, when you can make $300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary?\u201d\n\nBecause she might not win? Besides, Obama still has three years to go. And National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier, who has been harping on Obama\u2019s lack of leadership, says:\n\n\u201cPresident Obama needs to fire himself. Not literally, of course, but practically: He needs to shake up his team so thoroughly that the new blood imposes change on how he manages the federal bureaucracy and leads.\n\n\u201cA series of self-inflicted wounds during his fifth year in office, capped by the botched launch of the Affordable Care Act, have Americans questioning the president's competence and credibility.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll give the final word to First Read, with its inevitable Chuck Todd college football reference:\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing about politics: It can change in the blink of an eye. Who\u2019s up can go down; who\u2019s down can go up. And as we found out on Saturday, someone can run back a missed field goal kick 108 yards for an improbable come-from-behind victory.\u201d\n\nIf the odds of the president bouncing back are the same as that crazy play that won Auburn the game, he\u2019s in trouble.\n\nThe Woman Behind the Breast Photo\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 decision to illustrate a story about breast cancer in Israel with a front-page photo of a victim\u2019s breasts, with a partially exposed nipple, has kicked up quite a debate. I said on \u201cMedia Buzz\u201d that I thought the picture went too far and seemed a provocative departure for the Gray Lady.\n\nNow the unnamed 28-year-old has put out a statement, carried by Public Editor Margaret Sullivan:\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw the photo I did not find it either provocative or inappropriate. I thought it was powerful and told my story \u2013 I am a proud, young Jewish woman who had breast cancer, and I have a scar that proves it.\n\n\u201cI am not ashamed or embarrassed by the scar. Most of my breast was not exposed and the small part that was does not make the picture \u2018cheap.\u2019 I think it\u2019s very artistic.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect such controversy around the photo \u2013 but I\u2019m glad the photo caused an impact since I believe that there should be more awareness about breast cancer, genetic testing, the conflict of \u2018what to do\u2019 with a positive result, etc.\n\n\u201cI agreed to publish the photo since I wanted to raise awareness, but I decided to leave my identity unknown because I didn\u2019t want to become famous because I had cancer. The cancer I fought this past year is a part of me, but it\u2019s not who I am. It\u2019s not me. In addition, this photo was taken spontaneously and I didn\u2019t consult my close family beforehand, so I preferred to stay unknown.\n\n\u201cIn response to some readers\u2019 comment on the tattoo I have on my body, I come from a family of Holocaust survivors.\u201d\n\nWhatever the journalistic propriety of the decision, I\u2019m glad to get the perspective of the woman involved.\n\nBooker Bashful?\n\nThis made me laugh.\n\n\u201cCory Booker Shuns Spotlight,\u201d blares the Politico headline.\n\nAnd what is the lead anecdote showing that after one entire month in office, the New Jersey senator is keeping a low profile?\n\nAfter coming off the floor on the vote to change the filibuster rule, he blew off a Politico reporter: \u201cI got a lot of thoughts, but I\u2019m not going to share them right now.\u201d\n\nI mean, how dare he?\n\nTop Twitter Talk\n\nHillary in hiding\n\nClick for more from Media Buzz.",

A new U.N. report on warming and land use says climate change is hitting us where it counts : the stomach . The scientific report on Thursday , Aug. 8 , finds that as the world warms it degrades the land more . ( AP Photo/Luca Bruno , File )\nGENEVA ( AP ) \u2014 Human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the Earth \u2019 s land and the way people use the land is making global warming worse , a new United Nations scientific report says . That creates a vicious cycle which is already making food more expensive , scarcer and less nutritious .\n\u201c The cycle is accelerating , \u201d said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig , a co-author of the report . \u201c The threat of climate change affecting people \u2019 s food on their dinner table is increasing . \u201d\nBut if people change the way they eat , grow food and manage forests , it could help save the planet from a far warmer future , scientists said .\nEarth \u2019 s land masses , which are only 30 % of the globe , are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole . While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere , the land has been less talked about as part of climate change . A special report , written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world Thursday at a meeting in Geneva , proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings .\n\u201c The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution , \u201d said Valerie Masson-Delmotte , a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel \u2019 s working groups . \u201c Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable . \u201d\nScientists at Thursday \u2019 s press conference emphasized both the seriousness of the problem and the need to make societal changes soon .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t want a message of despair , \u201d said science panel official Jim Skea , a professor at Imperial College London . \u201c We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference . \u201d\nStill the stark message hit home hard for some of the authors .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve lost a lot of sleep about what the science is saying . As a person , it \u2019 s pretty scary , \u201d Koko Warner , a manager in the U.N . Climate Change secretariat who helped write a report chapter on risk management and decision-making , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 after the report was presented at the World Meteorological Organization headquarters in Geneva . \u201c We need to act urgently . \u201d\nThe report said climate change already has worsened land degradation , caused deserts to grow , permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought , fire , pests and disease . That \u2019 s happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air . Climate change has also added to the forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth .\n\u201c Climate change is really slamming the land , \u201d said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin , who wasn \u2019 t part of the study .\n\u201c The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases , \u201d the report said .\nIn the worst-case scenario , food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now . They go from high to \u201c very high \u201d risk with just another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1 degree Celsius ) of warming from now .\n\u201c The potential risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing , \u201d NASA \u2019 s Rosenzweig said . \u201c Just to give examples , the crop yields were effected in Europe just in the last two weeks . \u201d\nScientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide , the major heat-trapping gas , was that it made plants grow more and the world greener , Rosenzweig said . But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops .\nFor example , high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6 % to 13 % less protein , 4 % to 7 % less zinc and 5 % to 8 % less iron , she said .\nBut better farming practices \u2014 such as no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer applications \u2014 have the potential to fight global warming too , reducing carbon pollution up to 18 % of current emissions levels by 2050 , the report said .\nIf people change their diets , reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods , such as fruits , vegetables and seeds , the world can save as much as another 15 % of current emissions by mid-century . It would also make people more healthy , Rosenzweig said .\nThe science panel said they aren \u2019 t telling people what to eat because that \u2019 s a personal choice .\nStill , Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner , a panel leader from Germany who said he lost weight and felt better after reducing his meat consumption , told a reporter that if she ate less ribs and more vegetables \u201c that \u2019 s a good decision and you will help the planet reduce greenhouse gas emissions . \u201d\nReducing food waste can fight climate change even more . The report said that between 2010 and 2016 , global food waste accounted for 8 % to 10 % of heat-trapping emissions .\n\u201c Currently 25 % -30 % of total food produced is lost or wasted , \u201d the report said . Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land .\nWith just another 0.9 degrees F of warming ( 0.5 degrees C ) , which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years , the risk of unstable food supplies , wildfire damage , thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas \u201c are projected to be high , \u201d the report said .\nAt another 1.8 degrees F of warming ( 1 degree C ) from now , which could happen in about 50 years , it said those risks \u201c are projected to be very high . \u201d\nMost scenarios predict the world \u2019 s tropical regions will have \u201c unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid-to-late 21st century , \u201d the report noted .\nAgriculture and forestry together account for about 23 % of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth , slightly less than from cars , trucks , boats and planes . Add in transporting food , energy costs , packaging and that grows to 37 % , the report said .\nBut the land is also a great carbon \u201c sink , \u201d which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air .\nFrom about 2007 to 2016 , agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons ( 5.2 billion metric tons ) of carbon dioxide into the air , but pulled 12.3 billion tons ( 11.2 billion metric tons ) of it out .\n\u201c This additional gift from nature is limited . It \u2019 s not going to continue forever , \u201d said study co-author Luis Verchot , a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia . \u201c If we continue to degrade ecosystems , if we continue to convert natural ecosystems , we continue to deforest and we continue to destroy our soils , we \u2019 re going to lose this natural subsidy . \u201d\nOverall land emissions are increasing , especially because of cutting down forests in the Amazon in places such as Brazil , Colombia and Peru , Verchot said .\nRecent forest management changes in Brazil \u201c contradicts all the messages that are coming out of the report , \u201d P\u00f6rtner said .\nSaying \u201c our current way of living and our economic system risks our future and the future of our children , \u201d Germany \u2019 s environment minister , Svenja Schulze , questioned whether it makes sense for a country like Germany to import large amounts of soy from Latin America , where forests are being destroyed to plant the crop , to feed unsustainable numbers of livestock in Germany .\n\u201c We ought to recognize that we have profound limits on the amount of land available and we have to be careful about how we utilize it , \u201d said Stanford University environmental sciences chief Chris Field , who wasn \u2019 t part of the report .\nAP Science Writer Seth Borenstein reported from Washington .

        "content": "Investors , along with pretty much anyone watching the stock market , took some deep breaths Monday , as the US stocks followed Asian ones downward .\nConcern about China \u2019 s struggling economy had weighed on financial markets for weeks , and now the mood seemed grimmer than ever : Trading opened with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a stunning 1,000 points .\nBut trouble in China isn \u2019 t synonymous with a threat of global recession .\nIn fact , plenty of voices spoke up with a message of calm on Monday . Today \u2019 s situation contains genuine uncertainty about the pace of global economic growth . It \u2019 s not clear how bad China \u2019 s economic turmoil will get or how strong the impacts on the world economy will be . But to many forecasters , the visible risks today aren \u2019 t of the global-recession kind of magnitude .\nIn the end , Monday \u2019 s downdraft didn \u2019 t end up as severe as the opening moments suggested .\nThe Dow still posted a hefty 3.6 percent decline \u2013 down some 588 points for the day , to close at 15,871.35 . Losses in the broader Standard & Poor \u2019 s 500 index came even closer to a 4 percent decline for the day . And Monday \u2019 s selloff came after the Dow lost 1,000 points over the previous five days .\nOutside the US , declines in Europe , Japan , and Hong Kong were on the order of 5 percent . Behind it all was an 8.5 percent plunge on China \u2019 s benchmark stock index that prompted a \u201c Black Monday \u201d label in Shanghai news reports .\nFor shaken investors outside China , though , analysts say it can be helpful to keep Monday 's swoon in perspective . They cite several factors , chief among which is a US domestic economy that is still demonstrating some forward momentum .\nWhile stressing that `` economists ca n't even agree on predictions of things that already happened , '' Austan Goolsbee , a former top White House economic adviser now at the University of Chicago , told NPR . `` [ T ] here are several things that at least make me feel better now than I felt in the fall of 2008 . The first is the root of this crisis is not events happening in the United States . No . 2 , there 's in the US way less borrowing involved in this . It 's just [ an ] equity bubble . It 's just things moving around with stock prices . ''\nForecasters expect the latest reading on economic growth , coming this week , will show US expansion at a pace a bit above 3 percent annualized . The volume of home sales ticked up positively in the latest monthly report \u2013 to the highest rate in eight years \u2013 and improvement in the job market has brought unemployment down to 5.3 percent of the labor force .\nThat doesn \u2019 t settle the question of what the fair price is for US stocks . But some analysts say US stocks aren \u2019 t in \u201c bubble \u201d territory . \u201c In absolute terms , valuations look average , \u201d writes David Kelly , chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds . Relative to yields on alternative investments , \u201c they look cheap . \u201d\nWhat happens in China may not stay in China , but the effects shouldn \u2019 t be exaggerated .\n\u201c The recent data from other major economies have generally been good and there is little to justify fears of a major global downturn , \u201d forecasters at Capital Economics , a global research firm , wrote Monday . Their view , not an unusual one , is that China \u2019 s slowdown won \u2019 t become a \u201c hard landing \u201d for that nation .\nIn general , global economists say the cooling of China \u2019 s economy ripples outward to affect emerging-market nations more than developed ones .\nDemand for commodities like oil now is looking softer , and the decline in China \u2019 s currency puts pressure on other export-oriented economies . For the US , this might have only small economic effects \u2013 perhaps modestly weaker export opportunities to emerging nations , offset by some positive benefits as Americans reap more gain than harm from sagging commodity prices .\nWhile the size of Monday 's slump gave even hardened traders pause , the fact is that sizable downward \u201c corrections \u201d in share prices are a feature , not a bug , in a healthy stock market , analysts say . If a stock market goes too long in one relentless direction with little volatility , it \u2019 s often a sign that investors have mentally checked out .\nA \u201c trend is your friend \u201d attitude can lead to prices rising far beyond what fundamental facts justify . Then , analysts say , look out when such a bubble bursts . For example , America \u2019 s Nasdaq index today is still below the peak it reached more than 15 years ago in the era of hype about dotcom stocks .\nBy contrast , volatility shows some tug and pull in the markets as investors collectively argue about appropriate prices for investments .

        "content_original": "Investors, along with pretty much anyone watching the stock market, took some deep breaths Monday, as the US stocks followed Asian ones downward.\n\nConcern about China\u2019s struggling economy had weighed on financial markets for weeks, and now the mood seemed grimmer than ever: Trading opened with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a stunning 1,000 points.\n\n\n\nBut trouble in China isn\u2019t synonymous with a threat of global recession.\n\n\n\nIn fact, plenty of voices spoke up with a message of calm on Monday. Today\u2019s situation contains genuine uncertainty about the pace of global economic growth. It\u2019s not clear how bad China\u2019s economic turmoil will get or how strong the impacts on the world economy will be. But to many forecasters, the visible risks today aren\u2019t of the global-recession kind of magnitude.\n\nIn the end, Monday\u2019s downdraft didn\u2019t end up as severe as the opening moments suggested.\n\n\n\nThe Dow still posted a hefty 3.6 percent decline \u2013 down some 588 points for the day, to close at 15,871.35. Losses in the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index came even closer to a 4 percent decline for the day. And Monday\u2019s selloff came after the Dow lost 1,000 points over the previous five days.\n\n\n\nOutside the US, declines in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong were on the order of 5 percent. Behind it all was an 8.5 percent plunge on China\u2019s benchmark stock index that prompted a \u201cBlack Monday\u201d label in Shanghai news reports.\n\n\n\nFor shaken investors outside China, though, analysts say it can be helpful to keep Monday's swoon in perspective. They cite several factors, chief among which is a US domestic economy that is still demonstrating some forward momentum.\n\nWhile stressing that \"economists can't even agree on predictions of things that already happened,\" Austan Goolsbee, a former top White House economic adviser now at the University of Chicago, told NPR. \"[T]here are several things that at least make me feel better now than I felt in the fall of 2008. The first is the root of this crisis is not events happening in the United States. No. 2, there's in the US way less borrowing involved in this. It's just [an] equity bubble. It's just things moving around with stock prices.\"\n\nForecasters expect the latest reading on economic growth, coming this week, will show US expansion at a pace a bit above 3 percent annualized. The volume of home sales ticked up positively in the latest monthly report \u2013 to the highest rate in eight years \u2013 and improvement in the job market has brought unemployment down to 5.3 percent of the labor force.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t settle the question of what the fair price is for US stocks. But some analysts say US stocks aren\u2019t in \u201cbubble\u201d territory. \u201cIn absolute terms, valuations look average,\u201d writes David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Relative to yields on alternative investments, \u201cthey look cheap.\u201d\n\nWhat happens in China may not stay in China, but the effects shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated.\n\n\u201cThe recent data from other major economies have generally been good and there is little to justify fears of a major global downturn,\u201d forecasters at Capital Economics, a global research firm, wrote Monday. Their view, not an unusual one, is that China\u2019s slowdown won\u2019t become a \u201chard landing\u201d for that nation.\n\nIn general, global economists say the cooling of China\u2019s economy ripples outward to affect emerging-market nations more than developed ones.\n\nDemand for commodities like oil now is looking softer, and the decline in China\u2019s currency puts pressure on other export-oriented economies. For the US, this might have only small economic effects \u2013 perhaps modestly weaker export opportunities to emerging nations, offset by some positive benefits as Americans reap more gain than harm from sagging commodity prices.\n\nWhile the size of Monday's slump gave even hardened traders pause, the fact is that sizable downward \u201ccorrections\u201d in share prices are a feature, not a bug, in a healthy stock market, analysts say. If a stock market goes too long in one relentless direction with little volatility, it\u2019s often a sign that investors have mentally checked out.\n\nA \u201ctrend is your friend\u201d attitude can lead to prices rising far beyond what fundamental facts justify. Then, analysts say, look out when such a bubble bursts. For example, America\u2019s Nasdaq index today is still below the peak it reached more than 15 years ago in the era of hype about dotcom stocks.\n\nBy contrast, volatility shows some tug and pull in the markets as investors collectively argue about appropriate prices for investments. It can seem unsettling, but if it helps avoid market bubbles a useful purpose has been served.\n\nIt's been nearly four years since the US stock market has had a correction \u2013 a drop that's at least 10 percent (and less than the 20 percent that's known as a bear market). Typically, corrections happen more like once a year or so.\n\nFor long-term investors, dips can be buying opportunities. With the S&P index down more than 10 percent from levels seen in July, some investment strategists see this as a good buying opportunity, or perhaps getting close to it. Yes, there\u2019s the risk of more down days ahead.\n\nBut for a young or middle-aged worker with a steady paycheck, the larger point may be the long-term track record of the stock market (as embodied in diversified mutual funds) delivering positive returns for investors.\n\nFor millions of Americans, a preliminary hurdle is simply saving enough money to invest at all \u2013 in stocks or anything else.

For instance, a severe global sell-off by investors could ripple into the \"real\" economy by affecting consumer confidence. But he calls such scenarios merely possible, \"not likely.\"",

        "content": "During his campaign , Donald Trump successfully cast himself as the populist avenger for America \u2019 s working class .\nSo far , his cabinet picks appear to be either the revolutionary realization of that promise or a total capitulation to corporate America .\nAt a time when America \u2019 s partisan tribes are seeing the world through radically different lenses , the widely disparate perceptions of Mr. Trump \u2019 s cabinet are not surprising . But they do suggest that Trump appears to be going all in to disassemble what the right sees as President Obama \u2019 s \u201c regulatory state . \u201d\nTo liberals , these regulations were essential to preventing corporate America from running roughshod over Americans for their own gain . To conservatives , they were the shackles holding back America from shifting into a higher economic gear that would benefit all .\nIn many ways , the picks make sense . Mr. Trump is assembling a cabinet in his own image , full of tycoons , swagger , and political newcomers . It is the kind of group you \u2019 d assume a Manhattan billionaire would assemble .\nBut if Trump \u2019 s goal is to repay the Midwestern working-class voters who propelled him to an astonishing victory , the years ahead stand as a test . If anything , his cabinet represents a doubling down on the establishment Republican orthodoxy that economic growth comes by helping the \u201c job creators , \u201d with wealth trickling down to the middle class . Only on trade has Trump blazed a different path .\nThe question now is whether Trump \u2019 s new cabinet points America toward the transformational economic change he has promised or whether it is poised to make the gap between the haves and the have-nots even worse .\nNot surprisingly , each side has wildly different opinions on the subject .\nWriting in the conservative National Review , Andy Koenig suggests that \u201c the ever-growing regulatory state has harmed economic growth , job growth , and wage growth . \u201d\nCiting data from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University , which is heavily funded by the billionare Koch brothers , Mr. Koenig adds : \u201c Since 1980 , regulations have cost the economy $ 4 trillion , or about $ 13,000 per American . \u201d\nThey are sentiments that members of Trump \u2019 s cabinet have repeatedly expressed .\n\u2022 His choice for the Environmental Protection Agency , Scott Pruitt , has sued the EPA five times as the attorney general of Oklahoma and has called himself \u201c a leading advocate against the EPA \u2019 s activist agenda . \u201d\n\u2022 Proposed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been one of the nation \u2019 s most aggressive advocates for privatizing education and has successfully pushed her home state , Michigan , to dramatically expand charter schools at the expense of public schools .\n\u2022 Trump \u2019 s pick for Labor secretary , Andy Puzder , the chief executive of the Hardee \u2019 s fast-food chain , has repeatedly spoken out against raising the minimum wage and in an opinion article for Forbes , wrote : \u201c One can only wonder when the advocates of progressive economics will realize that , despite their best efforts , you can not regulate your way to economic prosperity . \u201d\nIt is a deregulation dream team \u2013 and a team that looks like Trump himself in some ways . Secretary of Commerce-designate Wilbur Ross is worth an estimated $ 2.5 billion . Ms. DeVos is from a family worth some $ 5.1 billion . Trump \u2019 s choice to run the Small Business Administration , Linda McMahon , has a net worth of about $ 1.15 billion with her husband .\n\u201c One newspaper criticized me , why can \u2019 t they have people of modest means ? Because I want people who made a fortune because now they \u2019 re negotiating with you , OK ? \u201d said Trump on Thursday night at his Des Moines , Iowa , political rally .\nThe clear goal : To unleash the unbridled power of American business for all Americans .\nIt \u2019 s not unusual for president-elects to pick cabinets that reflect their own personalities and interests . Mr. Obama \u2019 s first Cabinet was full of Democratic politicians and technocrats . Take Tim Geithner as secretary of the Treasury , or Hillary Clinton as secretary of State .\nBut the concern is that , with a cabinet full of billionaires running America , billionaires might be the big winners .\nSince Ronald Reagan launched America \u2019 s small government , anti-regulation revolution , the incomes of the top 1 percent have tripled , while the incomes of the middle 60 percent have gone up by less than half , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . For the 30 years before that , both went up at the same rate .\nAnd among Republican-run states that have moved aggressively toward the \u201c trickle down \u201d principle of economic growth , the results have been mixed . Some , like Texas , have done well , based on a strong energy economy . Others , such as Wisconsin , have seen average growth . And others , like Kansas , have cut taxes to the point that they teetered on the brink of disaster .\nIn Michigan , the move toward aggressive school choice \u2013 including things like for-profit charter schools and online charters , which generally have poor track records \u2013 has devastated public school budgets in certain cities .

        "content_original": "During his campaign, Donald Trump successfully cast himself as the populist avenger for America\u2019s working class.\n\nSo far, his cabinet picks appear to be either the revolutionary realization of that promise or a total capitulation to corporate America.\n\nAt a time when America\u2019s partisan tribes are seeing the world through radically different lenses, the widely disparate perceptions of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet are not surprising. But they do suggest that Trump appears to be going all in to disassemble what the right sees as President Obama\u2019s \u201cregulatory state.\u201d\n\nTo liberals, these regulations were essential to preventing corporate America from running roughshod over Americans for their own gain. To conservatives, they were the shackles holding back America from shifting into a higher economic gear that would benefit all.\n\nIn many ways, the picks make sense. Mr. Trump is assembling a cabinet in his own image, full of tycoons, swagger, and political newcomers. It is the kind of group you\u2019d assume a Manhattan billionaire would assemble.\n\nBut if Trump\u2019s goal is to repay the Midwestern working-class voters who propelled him to an astonishing victory, the years ahead stand as a test. If anything, his cabinet represents a doubling down on the establishment Republican orthodoxy that economic growth comes by helping the \u201cjob creators,\u201d with wealth trickling down to the middle class. Only on trade has Trump blazed a different path.\n\nThe question now is whether Trump\u2019s new cabinet points America toward the transformational economic change he has promised or whether it is poised to make the gap between the haves and the have-nots even worse.\n\nNot surprisingly, each side has wildly different opinions on the subject.\n\nA deregulation dream team\n\nWriting in the conservative National Review, Andy Koenig suggests that \u201cthe ever-growing regulatory state has harmed economic growth, job growth, and wage growth.\u201d\n\nCiting data from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which is heavily funded by the billionare Koch brothers, Mr. Koenig adds: \u201cSince 1980, regulations have cost the economy $4 trillion, or about $13,000 per American.\u201d\n\nThey are sentiments that members of Trump\u2019s cabinet have repeatedly expressed.\n\n\u2022 His choice for the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has sued the EPA five times as the attorney general of Oklahoma and has called himself \u201ca leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Proposed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been one of the nation\u2019s most aggressive advocates for privatizing education and has successfully pushed her home state, Michigan, to dramatically expand charter schools at the expense of public schools.\n\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s pick for Labor secretary, Andy Puzder, the chief executive of the Hardee\u2019s fast-food chain, has repeatedly spoken out against raising the minimum wage and in an opinion article for Forbes, wrote: \u201cOne can only wonder when the advocates of progressive economics will realize that, despite their best efforts, you cannot regulate your way to economic prosperity.\u201d\n\nIt is a deregulation dream team \u2013 and a team that looks like Trump himself in some ways. Secretary of Commerce-designate Wilbur Ross is worth an estimated $2.5 billion. Ms. DeVos is from a family worth some $5.1 billion. Trump\u2019s choice to run the Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon, has a net worth of about $1.15 billion with her husband.\n\n\u201cOne newspaper criticized me, why can\u2019t they have people of modest means? Because I want people who made a fortune because now they\u2019re negotiating with you, OK?\u201d said Trump on Thursday night at his Des Moines, Iowa, political rally.\n\nThe clear goal: To unleash the unbridled power of American business for all Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for president-elects to pick cabinets that reflect their own personalities and interests. Mr. Obama\u2019s first Cabinet was full of Democratic politicians and technocrats. Take Tim Geithner as secretary of the Treasury, or Hillary Clinton as secretary of State.\n\nA billionaire's club?\n\nBut the concern is that, with a cabinet full of billionaires running America, billionaires might be the big winners.\n\nSince Ronald Reagan launched America\u2019s small government, anti-regulation revolution, the incomes of the top 1 percent have tripled, while the incomes of the middle 60 percent have gone up by less than half, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. For the 30 years before that, both went up at the same rate.\n\nAnd among Republican-run states that have moved aggressively toward the \u201ctrickle down\u201d principle of economic growth, the results have been mixed. Some, like Texas, have done well, based on a strong energy economy. Others, such as Wisconsin, have seen average growth. And others, like Kansas, have cut taxes to the point that they teetered on the brink of disaster.\n\nIn Michigan, the move toward aggressive school choice \u2013 including things like for-profit charter schools and online charters, which generally have poor track records \u2013 has devastated public school budgets in certain cities. And some studies show the charter schools are achieving at lower rates than the public schools. A yearlong investigation by the Detroit Free Press found that the \u201crecord number of charter schools run by for-profit companies \u2026 rake in taxpayer money and refuse to detail how they spend it.\u201d\n\nHow much will the cabinet picks matter? Much will depend on what Trump leans on his cabinet for. It\u2019s possible he\u2019ll use it as a sounding board. But generally speaking, modern cabinets manage their departments, carrying out marching orders shaped much more by the president himself and the White House senior staff.\n\nWhat\u2019s important in a governing cabinet is ideological diversity, writes Bilal Baloch, a University of Oxford PhD candidate and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in New Delhi, in today\u2019s Monkey Cage political science blog at The Washington Post.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean members of opposing parties so much as people with a wide range of views. Otherwise cabinet members can harden around intolerant positions.\n\nAn administration needs internal ideological checks and balances and vigorous debate, according to Mr. Baloch.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

While Republicans believe those numbers will turn around, Democrats are likely to use the bill against GOP candidates in next year's midterm elections, arguing its benefits fall mostly on corporations and the rich rather than the middle class.\n\nThe tax bill isn\u2019t the only big item Republicans need to finalize before heading back to their districts for the holidays.\n\nLawmakers must also pass a stopgap measure to again avert a government shutdown that would begin Saturday.\n\nThe House is expected to move first, with Republicans poised to pass what they are describing as a \u201ccromnibus\u201d bill. It would pair full year of defense funding \u2014 a defense omnibus \u2014 with a continuing resolution that would fund the rest of the government into January.\n\nPairing those measures meets the demands of House Republicans who want to fund the Pentagon through the year, but it will run into a Democratic wall in the Senate, where the minority party will not back legislation that would fund the Pentagon for the year but the rest of the government for just a matter of weeks.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerOvernight Health Care: Trump officials making changes to drug pricing proposal | House panel advances flavored e-cig ban | Senators press FDA tobacco chief on vaping ban Chad Wolf becomes acting DHS secretary Schumer blocks drug pricing measure during Senate fight, seeking larger action MORE (D-N.Y.) warned that House Republicans are burning up hours of limited time by moving forward with a bill that can\u2019t get 60 votes.\n\n\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans should have known not to waste everyone's time with a partisan spending bill that could never pass the Senate,\u201d he said, noting that 44 of his 48 members have pledged to oppose it.\n\n\n\nDemocrats argue the legislative posturing takes away from ongoing bipartisan negotiations aimed at reaching a separate agreement on ceilings for defense and nondefense spending for the next year.\n\nAfter Congress passed an earlier stopgap measure to prevent a shutdown earlier in December, the idea was that lawmakers would agree to the ceilings and then approve a new stopgap to buy time to negotiate details.\n\nCongress does face another deadline. Without a permanent spending bill by mid-January, automatic spending cuts known as sequestration will become law and cut into the defense and nondefense budgets. Lawmakers in both parties want to avoid that.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Graham: Senate trial 'must expose the whistleblower' Graham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial MORE (R-Ky.) hasn\u2019t outlined what he will offer in response to the House legislation. But the Senate is expected to pass a short-term continuing resolution that would fund the government into early next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way the Senate can pass that bill,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt Roy Dean BluntGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Alcohol industry races to save tax break by year-end deadline McConnell, GOP leaders say they won't be watching House impeachment hearing MORE (R-Mo.), referring to the House\u2019s continuing resolution.\n\nHe predicted that the Senate will send a \u201cplain vanilla\u201d bill back to the House.\n\nFurther complicating their bid to fund the government, lawmakers are mulling trying to tackle leftover deadlines by dropping fights over health care, disaster aid and an extension of a controversial surveillance program into the funding bill.\n\n\n\nBut the moves would likely spark divisions between House and Senate Republicans and would frustrate conservatives and privacy hawks.\n\n\n\nSenate leadership has promised Sen.

That is turning Midwestern states more Republican , \u201d GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told reporters at the Monitor Breakfast on Thursday . At the same time , \u201c suburban voters \u2013 in particular suburban women \u2013 have been moving left . That \u2019 s turning states with big suburban populations \u2013 states like Texas , states like Georgia , states like Arizona \u2013 much more purple . \u201d\nLately , a rash of congressional Republicans opting not to run for reelection \u2013 a phenomenon some are calling the \u201c Texodus \u201d \u2013 has fueled Democrats \u2019 excitement . And to understand why Texas politics is shifting , many say , you shouldn \u2019 t just look at the state \u2019 s growing Hispanic population . You should look at where those GOP retirements are happening : around the booming , increasingly liberal cities .\nBut next year could , as the saying goes , be the year .\nAs Texas moves slowly but inevitably into majority-minority status , it \u2019 s become something of a biennial tradition to ask if the next election will finally mark the end of decades of Republican dominance in the state .\nIn the run-up to the 2008 election , when Brandy Derrick was first becoming politically aware , she joined millions of Texans in voting to reject Democratic nominee Barack Obama . Former GOP Sen. John McCain carried Tarrant County , where she lives , by double digits .\nHe won Texas by a similar margin , but Tarrant , which includes the city of Fort Worth and its suburbs , was the only urban county he won . Three other major metropolitan counties \u2013 Bexar ( San Antonio ) , Dallas , and Harris ( Houston ) \u2013 flipped that year to join Travis County ( Austin ) in voting Democratic , and they haven \u2019 t flipped back since .\nLast year , Tarrant County joined them , voting for a statewide Democrat \u2013 U.S. Senate candidate Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2013 for the first time since 1990 . Ms. Derrick , owner of Legal Ease Bookkeeping in Fort Worth , was not surprised .\n\u201c I think Texas as a whole is moving that way , \u201d she says .\nDemocrats certainly hope so \u2013 but then , they \u2019 ve been hoping so for a while . With Texas slowly but inevitably moving into majority-minority status , it \u2019 s become something of a biennial tradition in the Lone Star State to ask if the next election will finally mark the end of decades of Republican dominance .\nEvery dawn has been false . Last year , Sen. Ted Cruz beat Mr. O \u2019 Rourke despite becoming the first top-of-the-ticket Republican to lose in all of the major Texas metro areas since Barry Goldwater in 1964 . But next year could , as the saying goes , be the year . While no Democrat won statewide in 2018 , in terms of turnout and down-ballot races the party had its best election in decades .\nLoren Elliott/Reuters Beto O'Rourke speaks with members of the media following a rally at Texas Southern University in Houston , during his campaign for U.S. Senate , October 9 , 2018 . The former congressman , who lost that race to Sen. Ted Cruz , is now running for the Democratic presidential nomination .\nLately , a rash of congressional Republicans opting not to run for reelection \u2013 a phenomenon some are calling the \u201c Texodus \u201d \u2013 has only fueled Democrats \u2019 excitement . And to understand why Texas politics is shifting , many say , you shouldn \u2019 t just look at the state \u2019 s growing Hispanic population . You should look at where those GOP retirements are happening : around the booming , increasingly liberal cities .\n\u201c The two broad demographic trends that are occurring nationally are : number one , blue-collar working-class voters are becoming more conservative . That is turning Midwestern states more Republican , \u201d Senator Cruz told reporters at the Monitor Breakfast on Thursday . At the same time , \u201c suburban voters \u2013 in particular suburban women \u2013 have been moving left . That \u2019 s turning states with big suburban populations \u2013 states like Texas , states like Georgia , states like Arizona \u2013 much more purple . \u201d\nAs measured by job creation and population growth , the \u201c Texas Triangle \u201d bounded by Dallas-Fort Worth , Houston , and San Antonio-Austin is the strongest economic region in the United States . While Houston is the hub of the U.S. energy industry , big tech companies are settling in Austin ( Google and Apple ) and Dallas ( Uber ) .\nAnd with a large , young , and college-educated workforce flocking to live and work in the region , these Texas cities and suburbs have been both gaining political power and becoming more solidly liberal . Research by Ren\u00e9e Cross and Richard Murray at the University of Houston has found that voters in the 27 counties around big metro areas grew from 52 % of the total electorate in 1968 to 69 % in 2018 . Meanwhile , voters in the more rural counties \u2013 outside the Democratic strongholds in south Texas \u2013 decreased from 38 % to 8 % in that time .\nMr. O \u2019 Rourke in particular was effective in ginning up support and \u2013 crucially , for a low-turnout demographic \u2013 votes from young Texans . He carried the state \u2019 s five major urban counties by a combined 790,000 votes last year , six times more than Mr. Obama in 2012 . Registering and turning out more voters in those cities and suburbs is at the core of Texas Democrats \u2019 plan , released this week , to flip \u201c the biggest battleground state in the country . \u201d\nMichael Bonfigli/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Republican Sen.

But `` I think it will be closer than last time . ''\nThe \u201c Texodus \u201d suggests that Republicans in the state may have the same concerns .

That is turning Midwestern states more Republican,\u201d GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told reporters at the Monitor Breakfast on Thursday. At the same time, \u201csuburban voters \u2013 in particular suburban women \u2013 have been moving left. That\u2019s turning states with big suburban populations \u2013 states like Texas, states like Georgia, states like Arizona \u2013 much more purple.\u201d\n\nLately, a rash of congressional Republicans opting not to run for reelection \u2013 a phenomenon some are calling the \u201cTexodus\u201d \u2013 has fueled Democrats\u2019 excitement. And to understand why Texas politics is shifting, many say, you shouldn\u2019t just look at the state\u2019s growing Hispanic population. You should look at where those GOP retirements are happening: around the booming, increasingly liberal cities.\n\nBut next year could, as the saying goes, be the year.\n\nAs Texas moves slowly but inevitably into majority-minority status, it\u2019s become something of a biennial tradition to ask if the next election will finally mark the end of decades of Republican dominance in the state.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2008 election, when Brandy Derrick was first becoming politically aware, she joined millions of Texans in voting to reject Democratic nominee Barack Obama. Former GOP Sen. John McCain carried Tarrant County, where she lives, by double digits.\n\nHe won Texas by a similar margin, but Tarrant, which includes the city of Fort Worth and its suburbs, was the only urban county he won. Three other major metropolitan counties \u2013 Bexar (San Antonio), Dallas, and Harris (Houston) \u2013 flipped that year to join Travis County (Austin) in voting Democratic, and they haven\u2019t flipped back since.\n\nLast year, Tarrant County joined them, voting for a statewide Democrat \u2013 U.S. Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 for the first time since 1990. Ms. Derrick, owner of Legal Ease Bookkeeping in Fort Worth, was not surprised.\n\n\u201cI think Texas as a whole is moving that way,\u201d she says.\n\nDemocrats certainly hope so \u2013 but then, they\u2019ve been hoping so for a while. With Texas slowly but inevitably moving into majority-minority status, it\u2019s become something of a biennial tradition in the Lone Star State to ask if the next election will finally mark the end of decades of Republican dominance.\n\nEvery dawn has been false. Last year, Sen. Ted Cruz beat Mr. O\u2019Rourke despite becoming the first top-of-the-ticket Republican to lose in all of the major Texas metro areas since Barry Goldwater in 1964. But next year could, as the saying goes, be the year. While no Democrat won statewide in 2018, in terms of turnout and down-ballot races the party had its best election in decades.\n\nLoren Elliott/Reuters Beto O'Rourke speaks with members of the media following a rally at Texas Southern University in Houston, during his campaign for U.S. Senate, October 9, 2018. The former congressman, who lost that race to Sen. Ted Cruz, is now running for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nLately, a rash of congressional Republicans opting not to run for reelection \u2013 a phenomenon some are calling the \u201cTexodus\u201d \u2013 has only fueled Democrats\u2019 excitement.

        "content_original": "(Reuters) - North Korea\u2019s state-controlled newspaper on Sunday accused the United States of \u201cdouble-dealing\u201d and \u201chatching a criminal plot\u201d against Pyongyang, after Washington abruptly canceled a visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nNegotiations have been all but deadlocked since U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June.\n\nPompeo has pressed for tangible steps toward North Korea\u2019s abandonment of its nuclear arsenal while Pyongyang is demanding that Washington first make concessions of its own.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said U.S. special units based in Japan were staging an air drill aimed at \u201cthe infiltration into Pyongyang\u201d, citing a South Korean media outlet.\n\n\u201cSuch acts prove that the U.S. is hatching a criminal plot to unleash a war against the DPRK and commit a crime which deserves merciless divine punishment in case the U.S. fails in the scenario of the DPRK\u2019s unjust and brigandish denuclearisation first,\u201d the paper said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot but take a serious note of the double-dealing attitudes of the U.S. as it is busy staging secret drills involving man-killing special units while having a dialogue with a smile on its face,\u201d it noted.\n\nA spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said he had no information on the drill alleged in the newspaper. The U.S. military spokesman in South Korea was not immediately available to comment.\n\nThe editorial, which did not mention the Pompeo visit, urged Washington to give up the \u201cpointless military gamble\u201d and implement the Singapore agreement, in which the leaders pledged to work towards a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nSince the summit, the two sides have struggled to narrow differences over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nPyongyang is calling for a declaration of peace as part of security guarantees designed to encourage it to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, while the Trump administration says a peace deal and other concessions will only come after more progress on denuclearization.\n\nIn part to reassure North Korea, Trump canceled or delayed joint military drills with South Korea, but smaller exercises continue.\n\nTrump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing. China expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about Trump\u2019s comments, which it called \u201cirresponsible\u201d.",

Democrats have become too EXTREME and TOO DANGEROUS to govern , '' Trump tweeted Saturday . `` Republicans believe in the rule of law - not the rule of the mob . VOTE REPUBLICAN ! ''\nRepublicans argue top Democrats have only been fueling that characterization , signaling lately that they wo n't abide by the mantra that former first lady Michelle Obama famously used in the 2016 campaign \u2014 `` when they go low , we go high . ''\n`` When they go low , we kick them . That 's what this new Democratic Party is about , '' former Attorney General Eric Holder said over the weekend while campaigning in Georgia . `` We 're proud as hell to be Democrats . We 're going to fight for the ideals of the Democratic Party . ''\nHolder , who 's mulling a 2020 presidential bid , later clarified that he was n't advocating for outright violence .\n`` When I say we , you know , 'we kick 'em , ' I do n't mean we do anything inappropriate . We do n't do anything illegal , '' said Holder . `` But we got to be tough , and we have to fight for the very things that [ civil rights leaders ] John Lewis , Martin Luther King , Whitney Young \u2013 you know , all those folks gave to us . ''\nAnd 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also had harsh words for the GOP in an interview with CNN on Tuesday , saying , `` You can not be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for , what you care about . ''\n`` That 's why I believe , if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate , that 's when civility can start again . But until then , the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength , '' Clinton said . She bemoaned the treatment of the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault , Christine Blasey Ford , whom Trump openly mocked at a rally last week .\nRepublicans have used Clinton and Holder 's remarks as further justification for their `` mob '' characterization and the suggestion of violence or any confrontation in very personal ways , describing threats they received after they voted for Kavanaugh .\nColorado Sen. Cory Gardner , who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee tasked with protecting the GOP 's Senate majority this cycle , tweeted Wednesday , `` Just before I voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh , my wife received a text message of a graphic beheading . We now have public officials saying you should be uncivil to each other - a call for incivility .... We have our political disagreements and we should cherish the rights to express our disagreements . But when it comes to calls for violence and attempted murder and assassinations this country has gone too far and it 's time we step back from that brink .

Or does it only incite unstable people to violence , making them feel that assaulting a person is somehow politically justifiable ? '' Kelley Paul asked .\nFrank Luntz , a Republican pollster and messaging guru , said that the `` angry mob '' description was apt and that he had told GOP candidates to use it when talking about protesters and those who opposed Kavanaugh in the wake of sexual assault accusations and testimony from Ford .\n`` It is essential that [ senators ] are authentic and that they are accurate in their communication . When you see the video , that is exactly what it is , '' Luntz said . `` I have advised them not to overstate , but when you have videos of people chasing after senators and screaming at them , it really is an angry mob . It is accurate and it accurately describes what happens . ''\nLuntz said it was n't necessarily a `` turn-out mechanism , '' but was simply `` a description of what happened . ''\nGOP strategist Ken Spain , who was communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2010 when his party won back the House , said he thinks use of that term will escalate even more over the next month as Republicans try to sustain the enthusiasm bump they got in the wake of the Kavanaugh fight .\n`` The Kavanaugh debate clearly fueled Republican intensity over the course of the last few weeks . The question is whether that can be sustained in the final month of the election . Four weeks is an eternity in campaign politics , so Republicans are likely looking for a way to maintain the existing intensity level , '' Spain said .\nMeanwhile , some endangered Democrats are eschewing the pushback that Holder and Clinton are calling for . North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said on CNN that Clinton 's comments were `` ridiculous . ... I mean I ca n't imagine how you get anything done if you do n't bring civility back into politics , and that goes for both sides . ''\nHowever , Lawrence Jacobs , director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota , said what Republicans are pointing to , such as the protesters in the Capitol during and after Kavanaugh 's confirmation , were n't really unruly mobs .\n`` There were protesters in the Capitol who were making their voices heard , which is protected by the U.S. Constitution and something Republicans do all the time . That 's hardly something I would describe as a mob . I would describe that as noisy democracy , '' Jacobs said .\nAnd , Jacobs added , such strong language to appeal to your base is nothing new in American history .\n`` The specific language about mobs and lawlessness and chaos is something we heard from Republicans in the 1960s and 1970s . Some of it was in response to riots in cities . Republicans put a spotlight on it and used it as a way to say that Democrats were soft on crime , that they were encouraging chaos . It was very effective in the hands of Richard Nixon , '' he recalled .\n`` It speaks to this idea of insecurity , of anxiety , that we are at the point of this shift in our country . For Donald Trump 's core base , this is something he has skillfully mined for support . ''\nCould that rhetoric work ? In parts of the country \u2014 particularly deep red states that Democrats are defending in the battle for the Senate \u2014 it could . But , as Republicans struggle to hold onto the House \u2014 which is in danger of flipping in large part because of energized female voters in suburban districts that have turned on Trump \u2014 it could have an adverse effect .\n`` It will work in some parts of the country . I think of these red states where Democrats had shown some promise like Tennessee and Texas . ... I think it is going to bring out Republicans , '' Jacobs said . `` On the other hand , there are parts of the country where you have competitive districts , you 're going to see a high turnout among Democrats . I think what the president has done is energize women . I think it 's going to be a mixed bag . ''",

They also worry the move is part of a concerted effort to sideline the CDC at a time when President Trump Donald John TrumpDHS expands authority of personnel to collect information on people threatening monuments: report GOP signals Trump's payroll-tax cut in Republican coronavirus bill \u2014 for now Trump threatens to double down on Portland in other major cities MORE is seeking to deflect blame for his administration\u2019s response to the pandemic.\n\n\"Placing medical data collection outside of the leadership of public health experts could severely weaken the quality and availability of data, add an additional burden to already overwhelmed hospitals and add a new challenge to the U.S. pandemic response,\" Thomas File Jr., president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement.\n\nAdministration officials said the change is an attempt to modernize the reporting system, because the CDC database was too decentralized and out of date.\n\n\"The CDC\u2019s old data-gathering operation once worked well monitoring hospital information across the country, but it\u2019s an inadequate system today,\u201d Michael Caputo, HHS assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a statement.\n\nCDC Director Robert Redfield told reporters on a conference call Wednesday that his agency asked for the change.\n\n\"No one is taking access or data away from CDC,\" Redfield said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRedfield said the change will allow the NHSN to better focus on \"other critical areas\" of COVID-19, such as nursing homes.\n\n\"All elements of our public health system are being stretched right now, and streamlining the hospital reporting allows the NHSN to concentrate its COVID-19 activities on this high priority area of protecting the vulnerable in our nursing homes,\" Redfield said.\n\nJose Arrieta, HHS\u2019s chief information officer, said the goal is to better \u201callocate resources in real time, so that you can actually start to combat a pandemic like COVID-19.\"\n\nJanis Orlowski, the chief health care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said the Trump administration has pledged to retain data transparency and give hospitals and public health agencies access to the data.\n\n\"As long as the data is made public and the administration continues to interact with health experts and stakeholders to improve our response to the pandemic, we support the new process,\u201d Orlowski said in a statement.\n\nBut the new database, called HHS Protects, is not public, raising concerns that the data could be manipulated for political purposes.\n\nHoward Koh, former HHS assistant secretary for health in the Obama administration, said there is an argument to be made for upgrading public health data infrastructure.\n\n\"Public health surveillance infrastructure in particular has just not gotten the funding and the attention it needs and deserves. So that's a legitimate issue,\" Koh said.\n\nBut he questioned why the administration would need to completely overhaul the existing system instead of simply making improvements to it.\n\n\"Having such centralized information could be a way to identify places of highest needs as soon as possible and address them quickly through a national strategy,\" Koh said. \"But there hasn't been any national strategy.\"\n\nThe new HHS database is run by a private contractor called TeleTracking, which was awarded a $10 million contract in April.\n\nSen. Patty Murray Patricia (Patty) Lynn MurrayComedian Joel McHale: Reach out and help local restaurants, wear masks with your favorite message; Frontline Foods's Ryan Sarver says we are in inning 3 of the COVID-19 ballgame Our national forests need protection \u2014 and Congress can help Public health groups denounce new Trump move sidelining CDC MORE (Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Health Committee, has raised questions about the firm and the process by which it secured the contract. In June, she asked the CDC for information about the \u201cnoncompetitive, multimillion-dollar contract\u201d awarded for a \u201cduplicative health data system.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Wednesday, Murray said the timing of the new decision is also suspect.\n\n\"It\u2019s entirely unclear why the Trump Administration has asked states and hospitals to upend their reporting systems in the middle of a pandemic\u2014in 48 hours nonetheless\u2014without a single explanation as to why this new system is better or necessary,\" Murray said in a statement.\n\nAny move the Trump administration makes regarding the CDC is under a microscope.\n\nThe administration has effectively silenced the agency during much of the pandemic; four former CDC directors recently accused the White House of politicizing science and undermining health experts.\n\nTrump and key White House officials this week broadened their attacks by seeking to publicly discredit Anthony Fauci Anthony FauciFauci to throw out first pitch for Washington Nationals home opener The Hill's Coronavirus Report: Former HHS Secretary Sebelius gives Trump administration a D in handling pandemic; Oxford, AstraZeneca report positive dual immunity results from early vaccine trial Coronavirus Report: The Hill's Steve Clemons interviews Kathleen Sebelius MORE, the nation's top infectious diseases expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nCongressional Democrats warn that shifting more power to HHS is a dangerous move.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRep.

Meatpacking plant workers take new approach in COVID-19 safety push MORE (D-Conn.), who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees HHS funding, said the agency \"has been operating as a dangerous, political apparatus and cannot be trusted to share accurate hospital information with Congress and the American public.\"\n\nDeLauro added that the CDC, not HHS, \"was created as a nonpartisan entity to tackle public health crises like the one we\u2019re facing today and track data related to these crises.\"\n\nTrump officials say they are looking into concerns about public health data.\n\nArrieta said HHS is considering giving members of Congress access to the data and is \"exploring the best way to make this information available to the public.\"",

The IRS, however, has said audits don\u2019t prevent people from releasing their own tax information.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley on Tuesday reiterated Trump\u2019s desire to not release his returns while under audit.\n\n\"As I understand it, the president\u2019s pretty clear. Once he\u2019s out of audit, he\u2019ll think about doing it, but he\u2019s not inclined to do so at this time,\" Gidley said on Fox News.\n\nThe fight over Trump\u2019s tax returns is one of several battles that Democrats and Trump are having over investigations into the president\u2019s finances. On Monday, Trump and his businesses filed a lawsuit in an effort to block an accounting firm from complying with a congressional subpoena for financial records about the president.\n\nDemocrats are expected to take further steps in their efforts to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns following the second missed deadline. Eventually, the matter is expected to result in a court case.\n\nUpdated at 6:21 p.m.",

        "content": "The next big debate of the 2016 campaign is a day away , and pre-event \u201c spin \u201d is in full gear .\nHere \u2019 s how it goes : Our guy is great , and your guy can \u2019 t help your nominee , who \u2019 s hopeless . Reverse the names , rinse , and repeat .\nThe spin will go on in real time via social media and email while Gov . Mike Pence ( R ) of Indiana and Sen. Tim Kaine ( D ) of Virginia duke it out Tuesday night in the campaign \u2019 s one and only vice presidential debate . And after it \u2019 s over , efforts to sway the media narrative and , ultimately , public opinion will continue , perhaps for days .\nImage-making has been around since the beginning of the Republic , but in the era of social media , the art of spin may be changing in profound ways .\nConsider Walter Podrazik \u2019 s class on mass media and politics at the University of Illinois at Chicago . The day after the first Trump-Clinton debate , he asked his students what struck them about the spin .\nSpin ? They didn \u2019 t need to stick around for that , they told Mr. Podrazik . \u201c They had already experienced it , via Twitter , Facebook , and other shared messaging , in real time , while the debate unfolded , \u201d he says .\nThe \u201c before \u201d and \u201c after \u201d spinning is likely to be with us forever , but it \u2019 s the \u201c during \u201d part that has changed the game , thanks to social media . For those who enjoy real-time commentary , experiencing a debate solely within one \u2019 s own social-media ecosystem may point to a hardening of the ideological silos that people inhabit \u2013 and perhaps a hardening of political polarization .\n\u201c Research shows that we tend to interact on social media with people who are kind of like us , \u201d says David Redlawsk , a political scientist at the University of Delaware , Newark , and author of the book \u201c How Voters Decide. \u201d \u201c We don \u2019 t get overly challenged on our beliefs . \u201d\nThat may be no different from old-style socializing \u2013 at the Rotary Club or the women \u2019 s club or the neighborhood corner hangout . But more than ever with major political events , social media has brought analysis and spin into real time , favoring speed over contemplation and setting in motion a narrative that can be hard to change .\nAt the same time , social media can have a democratizing effect . Anybody can jump in with a pithy comment or observation .\nPerhaps Podrazik \u2019 s students are a harbinger of the future \u2013 a world in which a presidential debate ends , and is immediately followed on TV by \u2026 regularly scheduled programing , not pundits offering analysis and partisans trying to shape impressions of what just happened . And at the debate venue itself , maybe there \u2019 s no more \u201c spin alley , \u201d the place where reporters go for a post-game scrum with candidate surrogates .\n\u201c No spin alley , \u201d in fact , was one recommendation last year by the Annenberg Working Group on Presidential Debate Reform . The spin room is a \u201c tired ritual \u201d that adds to the \u201c spectacle \u201d and cost of the debates , and takes away from the real purpose \u2013 to get the candidates to hash out the issues of the day , the group \u2019 s report said . And besides , the spin is already happening via email and Twitter , the report added , echoing Podrazik \u2019 s students .\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates saw things differently , and kept the spin room \u2013 and the live audience , and all the hoopla . Which fit right into Republican nominee Donald Trump \u2019 s plan .\nAs he did after many of the GOP primary debates , Mr. Trump headed straight for the spin room after Monday \u2019 s debate , a first for a major-party presidential nominee . But that \u2019 s Trump , the one-time reality TV star . If there \u2019 s a limelight , he wants to be in the middle of it \u2013 no matter how well ( or not ) he did in a debate .\nSo clearly , it \u2019 s too soon to write off the old way of experiencing political debates . After all , a record-breaking 84 million people watched the first Trump-Clinton debate on TV \u2013 and not everyone , of course , was simultaneously checking the blizzard of insta-punditry available online .\n\u201c TV is still more important than Twitter and Facebook , \u201d says David Greenberg , author of the book \u201c Republic of Spin. \u201d \u201c That may not be true in 20 years\u2026 . But for now , the average citizen interested in politics is going to watch the debates on a TV channel and will be at least somewhat interested in what the anchors and pundits have to say . \u201d\nMany people , too , are curious what the candidate \u201c spinners \u201d have to say .

        "content_original": "The next big debate of the 2016 campaign is a day away, and pre-event \u201cspin\u201d is in full gear.\n\nHere\u2019s how it goes: Our guy is great, and your guy can\u2019t help your nominee, who\u2019s hopeless. Reverse the names, rinse, and repeat.\n\nThe spin will go on in real time via social media and email while Gov. Mike Pence (R) of Indiana and Sen. Tim Kaine (D) of Virginia duke it out Tuesday night in the campaign\u2019s one and only vice presidential debate. And after it\u2019s over, efforts to sway the media narrative and, ultimately, public opinion will continue, perhaps for days.\n\nImage-making has been around since the beginning of the Republic, but in the era of social media, the art of spin may be changing in profound ways.\n\nConsider Walter Podrazik\u2019s class on mass media and politics at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The day after the first Trump-Clinton debate, he asked his students what struck them about the spin.\n\nSpin? They didn\u2019t need to stick around for that, they told Mr. Podrazik. \u201cThey had already experienced it, via Twitter, Facebook, and other shared messaging, in real time, while the debate unfolded,\u201d he says.\n\nThe \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d spinning is likely to be with us forever, but it\u2019s the \u201cduring\u201d part that has changed the game, thanks to social media. For those who enjoy real-time commentary, experiencing a debate solely within one\u2019s own social-media ecosystem may point to a hardening of the ideological silos that people inhabit \u2013 and perhaps a hardening of political polarization.\n\n\u201cResearch shows that we tend to interact on social media with people who are kind of like us,\u201d says David Redlawsk, a political scientist at the University of Delaware, Newark, and author of the book \u201cHow Voters Decide.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t get overly challenged on our beliefs.\u201d\n\nThat may be no different from old-style socializing \u2013 at the Rotary Club or the women\u2019s club or the neighborhood corner hangout. But more than ever with major political events, social media has brought analysis and spin into real time, favoring speed over contemplation and setting in motion a narrative that can be hard to change.\n\nAt the same time, social media can have a democratizing effect. Anybody can jump in with a pithy comment or observation.\n\nNo more 'spin alley'?\n\nPerhaps Podrazik\u2019s students are a harbinger of the future \u2013 a world in which a presidential debate ends, and is immediately followed on TV by \u2026 regularly scheduled programing, not pundits offering analysis and partisans trying to shape impressions of what just happened. And at the debate venue itself, maybe there\u2019s no more \u201cspin alley,\u201d the place where reporters go for a post-game scrum with candidate surrogates.\n\n\u201cNo spin alley,\u201d in fact, was one recommendation last year by the Annenberg Working Group on Presidential Debate Reform. The spin room is a \u201ctired ritual\u201d that adds to the \u201cspectacle\u201d and cost of the debates, and takes away from the real purpose \u2013 to get the candidates to hash out the issues of the day, the group\u2019s report said. And besides, the spin is already happening via email and Twitter, the report added, echoing Podrazik\u2019s students.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates saw things differently, and kept the spin room \u2013 and the live audience, and all the hoopla. Which fit right into Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nAs he did after many of the GOP primary debates, Mr. Trump headed straight for the spin room after Monday\u2019s debate, a first for a major-party presidential nominee. But that\u2019s Trump, the one-time reality TV star. If there\u2019s a limelight, he wants to be in the middle of it \u2013 no matter how well (or not) he did in a debate.\n\nSo clearly, it\u2019s too soon to write off the old way of experiencing political debates. After all, a record-breaking 84 million people watched the first Trump-Clinton debate on TV \u2013 and not everyone, of course, was simultaneously checking the blizzard of insta-punditry available online.\n\n\u201cTV is still more important than Twitter and Facebook,\u201d says David Greenberg, author of the book \u201cRepublic of Spin.\u201d \u201cThat may not be true in 20 years\u2026. But for now, the average citizen interested in politics is going to watch the debates on a TV channel and will be at least somewhat interested in what the anchors and pundits have to say.\u201d\n\nMany people, too, are curious what the candidate \u201cspinners\u201d have to say. And as long as the ratings are there, the networks will keep showing it \u2013 \u201cnot because we believe it lock, stock, and barrel, but because it\u2019s part of the process,\u201d says Mr. Greenberg, an associate professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.\n\nViewers know that it\u2019s spin, he says, because it\u2019s presented as such.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re capable of arguing with it, criticizing it, and seeing through it, if it\u2019s phony or cynical, and applauding it if it\u2019s done in the service of the candidate we like and we think it\u2019s effective,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201cSo people aren\u2019t easily duped by these arguments.\u201d\n\n'Shut the TV off, get off social media'\n\nStill, there are those who argue for just tuning out once a debate is over.\n\n\u201cI basically tell people after debates, shut the TV off,\u201d says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \u201cGet off social media, and ask yourself, \u2018What was important to you? What did you learn that mattered to you?\u2019 before all this other stuff crowds out your learning.\u201d\n\nOf course, anyone who did so last Monday night would have missed the unprecedented spectacle of Trump and his entourage descending upon the spin room. \u201cAll the online polls say I was the big winner,\u201d he boasted.

        "content": "\u201c Hong Kong was in lockdown on Tuesday , with barricades in the city center , shuttered stores and a heavy riot police presence , as authorities scrambled to ensure protests do not overshadow China \u2019 s National Day festivities in Beijing . The former British colony has been wracked by nearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations. \u201d Reuters\nBoth sides are applauding the protestors and calling on world leaders to support them as much as possible :\n\u201c Hong Kong \u2019 s protesters are outfoxing Beijing worldwide\u2026 From Oslo to Osaka , Congress to the United Nations , Taiwan to Twitter , Hong Kongers have taken their DIY approach to protest to a global audience . Celebrity supporters testify in high-profile settings ; highly targeted , crowdfunded media campaigns aim to keep the issue in the spotlight ; and viral videos , catchy slogans , and even a movement anthem and flag help magnify the message on social media\u2026 [ In the ] battle over international public opinion , it is Beijing and its minions that are outgunned . \u201d\n\u201c Until now , Hong Kong enjoyed much freedom and democratic rule . That was a precondition for its return to China from Britain in 1997 . The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration , signed by the UK \u2019 s then-prime minister , Margaret Thatcher , and then-Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang , guaranteed Hong Kong \u2019 s autonomy . The Beijing-selected local government is fundamentally violating that pact . Residents fear they \u2019 re losing the political system they inherited from Britain , a system they know and trust\u2026\n\u201c The people of Hong Kong have been sending the Chinese government a loud message : We don \u2019 t want what you \u2019 re peddling . We want freedom and democracy\u2026 America should answer that call with all the moral and diplomatic support we can muster \u2014 and work double-time to ensure democracy and human rights in Hong Kong . \u201d\n\u201c At the time of the British handover , there was optimistic talk about how an emerging China \u2019 s growing global economic integration would encourage a political transformation and , with it , Beijing \u2019 s gradual embrace of western values and international rules-based systems . Such hopes now appear largely misplaced . What Hong Kong shows clearly are the limits to China \u2019 s adaptability \u2013 and the Communist party \u2019 s undying attachment to political uniformity , not plurality\u2026\n\u201c As a legal guarantor of Hong Kong \u2019 s freedoms , Britain has a duty to stand up to China \u2019 s repressive behaviour . But aside from a few carefully phrased diplomatic whinges , it has signally failed to do so . Such weak shilly-shallying is contemptuously dismissed in Beijing . The US counts itself a champion of global democratic values , or did so before Donald Trump took office . Congress has made threatening noises but the White House has taken no substantive action\u2026 In Washington , London and other capitals , it \u2019 s plain that money and power speak louder than democratic ideals , broken umbrellas and bloodied heads . Perhaps it was always thus . Yet if Hong Kong is permanently , definitively lost to democracy , it will be , at least in part , because the west failed to fight for it . \u201d\n\u201c Over the last year , millions of people have risked their lives to challenge tyrannical regimes around the world . Venezuelans have poured into the streets to protest socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro , who has bankrupted a once-wealthy country . Demonstrations in Sudan and Algeria have forced longtime despots from power\u2026\n\u201c Thirty years ago , we watched the Chinese government lead a brutal crackdown against peaceful protestors in Tiananmen Square . Thousands were killed and many more were wounded . We know the nature of this communist regime and it is not afraid to use violence against its own people\u2026 The protestors in Hong Kong understand this history and still choose to stand in the street and fight for their future . They are not afraid . Nor are the Venezuelans , Sudanese or Russians who are risking their lives to demand more from their governments . The opportunity to turn the tide against tyranny is one that we can not squander . As people from every corner of the world fight the global assault on democracy , America must fight with them . \u201d\n\u201c The United States should immediately pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 . This legislation proactively enshrines American support for Hong Kong \u2019 s democracy and autonomy into law and would send a powerful symbolic message to the people of Hong Kong : that American support for Hong Kong is more than just empty words . Tens of thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets earlier this month to call for the act to be passed into law\u2026 It [ would send ] a signal to China that it can not erode the city 's autonomy while reaping the benefits\u2026\n\u201c Hong Kong is at a historic watershed . Its people are on the frontlines of the global fight for liberal democratic values . The passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would not only be a momentous symbolic statement that the world still cares about the people of Hong Kong , it would help incentivize the Hong Kong government to respect people 's freedoms . It is time for the act to be passed . \u201d\n\u201c Leaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle have made strong statements condemning the Chinese and Hong Kong governments ' exploits \u2013 but now is the time to attach action to words\u2026\n\u201c [ The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 ] requires the State Department to annually certify and report to Congress whether Hong Kong \u2019 s status of autonomy , and the government \u2019 s adherence to protecting civil liberties and upholding of the rule of law justify its continued special status .

        "content_original": "\u201cHong Kong was in lockdown on Tuesday, with barricades in the city center, shuttered stores and a heavy riot police presence, as authorities scrambled to ensure protests do not overshadow China\u2019s National Day festivities in Beijing. The former British colony has been wracked by nearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations.\u201d Reuters\n\n\n\nBoth sides are applauding the protestors and calling on world leaders to support them as much as possible:\n\n\n\n\u201cHong Kong\u2019s protesters are outfoxing Beijing worldwide\u2026 From Oslo to Osaka, Congress to the United Nations, Taiwan to Twitter, Hong Kongers have taken their DIY approach to protest to a global audience. Celebrity supporters testify in high-profile settings; highly targeted, crowdfunded media campaigns aim to keep the issue in the spotlight; and viral videos, catchy slogans, and even a movement anthem and flag help magnify the message on social media\u2026 [In the] battle over international public opinion, it is Beijing and its minions that are outgunned.\u201d\n\nChris Horton, The Atlantic\n\n\n\n\u201cUntil now, Hong Kong enjoyed much freedom and democratic rule. That was a precondition for its return to China from Britain in 1997. The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed by the UK\u2019s then-prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, and then-Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, guaranteed Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. The Beijing-selected local government is fundamentally violating that pact. Residents fear they\u2019re losing the political system they inherited from Britain, a system they know and trust\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people of Hong Kong have been sending the Chinese government a loud message: We don\u2019t want what you\u2019re peddling. We want freedom and democracy\u2026 America should answer that call with all the moral and diplomatic support we can muster \u2014 and work double-time to ensure democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nElisha Maldonado, New York Post\n\n\n\n\u201cAt the time of the British handover, there was optimistic talk about how an emerging China\u2019s growing global economic integration would encourage a political transformation and, with it, Beijing\u2019s gradual embrace of western values and international rules-based systems. Such hopes now appear largely misplaced. What Hong Kong shows clearly are the limits to China\u2019s adaptability \u2013 and the Communist party\u2019s undying attachment to political uniformity, not plurality\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a legal guarantor of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, Britain has a duty to stand up to China\u2019s repressive behaviour. But aside from a few carefully phrased diplomatic whinges, it has signally failed to do so. Such weak shilly-shallying is contemptuously dismissed in Beijing. The US counts itself a champion of global democratic values, or did so before Donald Trump took office. Congress has made threatening noises but the White House has taken no substantive action\u2026 In Washington, London and other capitals, it\u2019s plain that money and power speak louder than democratic ideals, broken umbrellas and bloodied heads. Perhaps it was always thus. Yet if Hong Kong is permanently, definitively lost to democracy, it will be, at least in part, because the west failed to fight for it.\u201d\n\nSimon Tisdall, The Guardian\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the last year, millions of people have risked their lives to challenge tyrannical regimes around the world. Venezuelans have poured into the streets to protest socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro, who has bankrupted a once-wealthy country. Demonstrations in Sudan and Algeria have forced longtime despots from power\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cThirty years ago, we watched the Chinese government lead a brutal crackdown against peaceful protestors in Tiananmen Square. Thousands were killed and many more were wounded. We know the nature of this communist regime and it is not afraid to use violence against its own people\u2026 The protestors in Hong Kong understand this history and still choose to stand in the street and fight for their future. They are not afraid. Nor are the Venezuelans, Sudanese or Russians who are risking their lives to demand more from their governments. The opportunity to turn the tide against tyranny is one that we cannot squander. As people from every corner of the world fight the global assault on democracy, America must fight with them.\u201d\n\nMichael McCaul, Fox News\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States should immediately pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019. This legislation proactively enshrines American support for Hong Kong\u2019s democracy and autonomy into law and would send a powerful symbolic message to the people of Hong Kong: that American support for Hong Kong is more than just empty words. Tens of thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets earlier this month to call for the act to be passed into law\u2026 It [would send] a signal to China that it cannot erode the city's autonomy while reaping the benefits\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cHong Kong is at a historic watershed. Its people are on the frontlines of the global fight for liberal democratic values. The passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would not only be a momentous symbolic statement that the world still cares about the people of Hong Kong, it would help incentivize the Hong Kong government to respect people's freedoms. It is time for the act to be passed.\u201d\n\nJohnny Patterson, The Hill\n\n\n\n\u201cLeaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle have made strong statements condemning the Chinese and Hong Kong governments' exploits \u2013 but now is the time to attach action to words\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c[The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019] requires the State Department to annually certify and report to Congress whether Hong Kong\u2019s status of autonomy, and the government\u2019s adherence to protecting civil liberties and upholding of the rule of law justify its continued special status. The Commerce Department would also submit an annual report to Congress that determines if China is exploiting Hong Kong to circumvent U.S. sanctions and export controls. This important bill also would ensure that violators of human rights in the region are held accountable by applying sanctions and banning entry to the U.S\u2026 [and] send an important signal that the United States will act to protect the rights of the people of Hong Kong \u2013 and continue to be a leading advocate for freedom in the world.\u201d\n\nNewt Gingrich, Fox News",

President Barack Obama 's nominee , federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland , was blocked by Senate Republicans before Trump nominated Gorsuch from a list of 21 potential choices on Jan. 31 , 2017 . It took another 10 weeks , $ 17 million in outside spending and a Senate rules change to win confirmation without the 60 votes previously required to reach the Senate floor .\nDespite the histrionics , Gorsuch emerged from the confirmation battle relatively unscathed , a tribute to his impeccable credentials as a Denver-based judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit . He had degrees from Columbia , Harvard Law and Oxford and a high-level stint at the Department of Justice . His mother , Anne Gorsuch Burford , had been in President Ronald Reagan 's Cabinet .\nGorsuch took his seat four months short of his 50th birthday , becoming the first former Supreme Court law clerk to serve alongside his ex-boss , Justice Anthony Kennedy . In short order , he was peppering lawyers with questions such as `` Where in the statute is that provided ? '' and admonishments such as `` I look at the text of the Constitution , always a good place to start . ''\n`` I really don \u2019 t think we could have seen a justice any more committed to textualism and originalism than he is , '' says Randy Barnett , a professor at Georgetown University Law Center . `` He has lived up to very high expectations . \u201d\nLiberals saw his loud entrance differently , decrying his legal philosophy , his behavior on the bench , and his writing style . Ian Millhiser , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , warned early on that `` Gorsuch will make liberals miss Scalia . ''\nIn his initial opinions , concurrences and dissents , Gorsuch has done just that . When the court allowed part of Trump 's immigration travel ban against majority-Muslim countries to be implemented temporarily , he said he would have green-lighted it in full . When the court ruled that a Missouri church can receive public funds for playground resurfacing , he said religious discrimination is unconstitutional `` on the playground or anywhere else . ''\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed friend-of-the-court briefs in 10 cases decided since Gorsuch came on the court last April , and he 's taken their side nine times , along with most of his colleagues .\n`` It does seem that he is being that reliable , pro-corporate vote that business thought he would be , '' says Elizabeth Wydra , president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center .\nGorsuch has teamed up with Justice Clarence Thomas , the court 's most conservative member , in several dissents . Last year , the pair unsuccessfully urged their colleagues to consider lifting a ban on unlimited contributions to political parties . This year , they failed to convince the court to consider limiting administrative agencies ' authority to interpret their own regulations .\nBut when the court refused to hear a challenge to California 's 10-day waiting period for gun purchases , Gorsuch surprised some conservatives by not joining Thomas ' lone dissent . The decision came just days after a gunman killed 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Fla .\nIf Gorsuch shied away in that case , he has n't been shy often .\nHe wrote a lengthy , 12-page dissent to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 's opinion in the first case he heard , suggesting that the court `` just follow the words of the statute as written . '' He said Kennedy 's landmark 2015 opinion declaring same-sex marriage constitutional did not address \u2014 `` let alone clearly '' \u2014 the birth certificate challenge brought by two lesbian couples in Arkansas .\nHis willingness to speak at Trump International Hotel last September sparked objections from some ethics experts who noted a case involving foreign payments there could one day reach the high court . Gorsuch used the occasion to urge that fellow conservatives `` cherish the din of democracy . ''\nThat din hangs over major cases to be decided by the end of June involving the power of public employee unions , the religious rights of same-sex marriage objectors , partisan efforts by states to influence elections and other issues . Gorsuch 's vote could be critical in several of them \u2014 and that worries liberals .\n\u201c So far he \u2019 s staked out extremely conservative positions , '' says Nan Aron , president of the liberal Alliance for Justice . \u201c He is as ultra-conservative as we predicted he would be . \u201d\nGorsuch 's efforts , however , may be driven more by judicial philosophy than ideology . His devotion to the balance of powers outlined in the Constitution , for instance , will make him a force on the court for cutting back on the power of what conservatives call the `` administrative state . ''\nTwo cases granted for next year \u2014 presumably with Gorsuch 's support \u2014 may advance that cause . One questions the attorney general 's authority to decide whether a sex offender law 's registration rules should apply to those convicted before it was enacted . The other challenges the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service 's power to preserve habitat for a rare breed of frog without judicial review .\n\u201c I think Justice Gorsuch would want to see courts be more skeptical of how much power the bureaucracy has , and to require Congress to pass more precise laws , '' says Josh Blackman , an associate law professor at South Texas College of Law who follows the Supreme Court closely .\nOn that subject , Gorsuch is ahead of Scalia , who once put more faith in the executive and legislative branches . But in other ways \u2014 from his core legal philosophy to his supreme self-confidence \u2014 he is very much like his predecessor on the court .\n`` Lots of people were painting him as some sort of monster , '' says Carrie Severino , chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network , which spearheaded the effort to get Gorsuch confirmed last year . `` There has n't been a dramatic shift on the court , and that should n't be surprising . ''\nMore : For Supreme Court , the term that just ended was the calm before the storm",

It took another 10 weeks, $17 million in outside spending and a Senate rules change to win confirmation without the 60 votes previously required to reach the Senate floor.\n\nDespite the histrionics, Gorsuch emerged from the confirmation battle relatively unscathed, a tribute to his impeccable credentials as a Denver-based judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. He had degrees from Columbia, Harvard Law and Oxford and a high-level stint at the Department of Justice. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, had been in President Ronald Reagan's Cabinet.\n\nGorsuch took his seat four months short of his 50th birthday, becoming the first former Supreme Court law clerk to serve alongside his ex-boss, Justice Anthony Kennedy. In short order, he was peppering lawyers with questions such as \"Where in the statute is that provided?\" and admonishments such as \"I look at the text of the Constitution, always a good place to start.\"\n\n\"I really don\u2019t think we could have seen a justice any more committed to textualism and originalism than he is,\" says Randy Barnett, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. \"He has lived up to very high expectations.\u201d\n\nLiberals saw his loud entrance differently, decrying his legal philosophy, his behavior on the bench, and his writing style. Ian Millhiser, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, warned early on that \"Gorsuch will make liberals miss Scalia.\"\n\nIn his initial opinions, concurrences and dissents, Gorsuch has done just that. When the court allowed part of Trump's immigration travel ban against majority-Muslim countries to be implemented temporarily, he said he would have green-lighted it in full. When the court ruled that a Missouri church can receive public funds for playground resurfacing, he said religious discrimination is unconstitutional \"on the playground or anywhere else.\"\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed friend-of-the-court briefs in 10 cases decided since Gorsuch came on the court last April, and he's taken their side nine times, along with most of his colleagues.\n\n\"It does seem that he is being that reliable, pro-corporate vote that business thought he would be,\" says Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\nGorsuch has teamed up with Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's most conservative member, in several dissents. Last year, the pair unsuccessfully urged their colleagues to consider lifting a ban on unlimited contributions to political parties. This year, they failed to convince the court to consider limiting administrative agencies' authority to interpret their own regulations.\n\nBut when the court refused to hear a challenge to California's 10-day waiting period for gun purchases, Gorsuch surprised some conservatives by not joining Thomas' lone dissent. The decision came just days after a gunman killed 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nKey vote on major cases\n\nIf Gorsuch shied away in that case, he hasn't been shy often.\n\nHe wrote a lengthy, 12-page dissent to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's opinion in the first case he heard, suggesting that the court \"just follow the words of the statute as written.\" He said Kennedy's landmark 2015 opinion declaring same-sex marriage constitutional did not address \u2014 \"let alone clearly\" \u2014 the birth certificate challenge brought by two lesbian couples in Arkansas.\n\nHis willingness to speak at Trump International Hotel last September sparked objections from some ethics experts who noted a case involving foreign payments there could one day reach the high court. Gorsuch used the occasion to urge that fellow conservatives \"cherish the din of democracy.\"\n\nThat din hangs over major cases to be decided by the end of June involving the power of public employee unions, the religious rights of same-sex marriage objectors, partisan efforts by states to influence elections and other issues. Gorsuch's vote could be critical in several of them \u2014 and that worries liberals.\n\n\u201cSo far he\u2019s staked out extremely conservative positions,\" says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. \u201cHe is as ultra-conservative as we predicted he would be.\u201d\n\nGorsuch's efforts, however, may be driven more by judicial philosophy than ideology. His devotion to the balance of powers outlined in the Constitution, for instance, will make him a force on the court for cutting back on the power of what conservatives call the \"administrative state.\"\n\nTwo cases granted for next year \u2014 presumably with Gorsuch's support \u2014 may advance that cause. One questions the attorney general's authority to decide whether a sex offender law's registration rules should apply to those convicted before it was enacted. The other challenges the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's power to preserve habitat for a rare breed of frog without judicial review.\n\n\u201cI think Justice Gorsuch would want to see courts be more skeptical of how much power the bureaucracy has, and to require Congress to pass more precise laws,\" says Josh Blackman, an associate law professor at South Texas College of Law who follows the Supreme Court closely.\n\nOn that subject, Gorsuch is ahead of Scalia, who once put more faith in the executive and legislative branches. But in other ways \u2014 from his core legal philosophy to his supreme self-confidence \u2014 he is very much like his predecessor on the court.\n\n\"Lots of people were painting him as some sort of monster,\" says Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network, which spearheaded the effort to get Gorsuch confirmed last year. \"There hasn't been a dramatic shift on the court, and that shouldn't be surprising.\"\n\nMore:Neil Gorsuch: Stellar r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and Scalia-like legal philosophy\n\nMore:Supreme Court faces blockbuster term -- and Trump\n\nMore:For Supreme Court, the term that just ended was the calm before the storm",

In March , it had been announced that he would join the president \u2019 s legal team , together with his wife and fellow attorney Victoria Toensing . Later , however , a statement was issued by Trump \u2019 s lawyer Jay Sekulow noting that the couple would not join up after all because of \u201c conflicts . \u201d\nDiGenova and Toensing are frequent guests on cable television , however , where they continue to urge a hard line from Trump toward the investigation .\nIn his Monday interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , diGenova referred to Mueller and the people who surround him as \u201c legal thugs , \u201d adding that sitting down with them would be a \u201c terrible mistake \u201d for Trump .\nThere could be a price to be paid for not volunteering for such an interview .\nAccording to a Washington Post report , Mueller had suggested during a meeting back in March that he might issue a subpoena if Trump did not consent to an interview .\nThe mere act of having a subpoena issued against him could be damaging for Trump . If he challenged it , the battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court .\nThe balance of legal opinion holds that Trump would be likely to lose such a fight , though even some Trump critics acknowledge it is not an open-and-shut case .\nThe problem is even more acute in the political realm , where the president could be trying to fight off a subpoena at the same time as he is trying to rally the Republican Party to fight the midterm elections in a difficult climate .\nHarry Litman , a former deputy assistant attorney general during the Clinton administration , said that a legal battle over a subpoena would take a minimum of \u201c five or six months . \u201d\n\u201c That harms Mueller in some ways but it harms Trump worse , because it makes it harder for him to call for [ Mueller \u2019 s ] ouster , \u201d Litman said . \u201c And there may also have been a turn in the House , and maybe even in the Senate by then . So time is not on his side . \u201d\nGiven those downsides , Litman suggested it was likely there could be another round of negotiations between Mueller \u2019 s team and the president \u2019 s lawyers , aimed at coming up with a compromise arrangement .

In March, it had been announced that he would join the president\u2019s legal team, together with his wife and fellow attorney Victoria Toensing. Later, however, a statement was issued by Trump\u2019s lawyer Jay Sekulow noting that the couple would not join up after all because of \u201cconflicts.\u201d\n\nDiGenova and Toensing are frequent guests on cable television, however, where they continue to urge a hard line from Trump toward the investigation.\n\nIn his Monday interview with The Hill, diGenova referred to Mueller and the people who surround him as \u201clegal thugs,\u201d adding that sitting down with them would be a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d for Trump.\n\nThere could be a price to be paid for not volunteering for such an interview.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post report, Mueller had suggested during a meeting back in March that he might issue a subpoena if Trump did not consent to an interview.\n\nThe mere act of having a subpoena issued against him could be damaging for Trump. If he challenged it, the battle could go all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe balance of legal opinion holds that Trump would be likely to lose such a fight, though even some Trump critics acknowledge it is not an open-and-shut case.\n\nThe problem is even more acute in the political realm, where the president could be trying to fight off a subpoena at the same time as he is trying to rally the Republican Party to fight the midterm elections in a difficult climate.\n\nHarry Litman, a former deputy assistant attorney general during the Clinton administration, said that a legal battle over a subpoena would take a minimum of \u201cfive or six months.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat harms Mueller in some ways but it harms Trump worse, because it makes it harder for him to call for [Mueller\u2019s] ouster,\u201d Litman said. \u201cAnd there may also have been a turn in the House, and maybe even in the Senate by then. So time is not on his side.\u201d\n\nGiven those downsides, Litman suggested it was likely there could be another round of negotiations between Mueller\u2019s team and the president\u2019s lawyers, aimed at coming up with a compromise arrangement. He was not, however, optimistic about this bearing fruit.\n\nReferring to Trump\u2019s lawyers, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see them offering him up for sworn testimony. And I don\u2019t see Mueller settling for anything less.\u201d\n\nSam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign aide, argued that the president should only comply with a request for an interview if it pertained to the allegations of Russian collusion during the campaign.\n\nNunberg insisted that such allegations were false and that therefore Trump had nothing to lose by speaking about them.\n\nBut he was much more resistant to the idea that the president should be drawn into broader testimony.\n\nThe firing of FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyThere are poor ideas, bad ones and Facebook's Libra Trump has considered firing official who reported whistleblower complaint to Congress: report Broadcast, cable news networks to preempt regular programming for Trump impeachment coverage MORE, for example, was among the issues that were raised in a list of questions that emerged from previous discussions between the Mueller and Trump teams.

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump \u2019 s decision to double steel tariffs on Turkey as its government battled a currency collapse marked a departure for the U.S. from how it traditionally handles financial turmoil hitting emerging markets .\nWashington has generally tried to calm global markets in such moments , especially when investors are gripped by fear of contagion . Mr. Trump instead squeezed Ankara further , raising tariffs on Turkish steel imports to 50 % and aluminum to 20 % , which deepened the Turkish lira \u2019 s drop and worsened market fears that its banks could be shaken .\nAdministration officials didn \u2019 t clarify Mr. Trump \u2019 s motives . The move followed a series of actions the Trump administration has taken in recent weeks to step up economic pressure on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to release American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson .\nThe doubled tariffs weren \u2019 t related to Mr. Brunson , administration officials said Friday . White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the tariffs were meant to protect the U.S. on national-security grounds , \u201c independent of negotiations on trade or any other matter . \u201d\nIn a formal proclamation of the move issued Friday night\u2014nearly 12 hours after the president first announced it on Twitter\u2014the White House said the action was taken because the original global tariffs hadn \u2019 t done as much as the administration had desired to boost domestic production of steel and aluminum . The statement didn \u2019 t explain why Turkey alone was hit with the higher tariffs .\nIn his tweet , Mr. Trump seemed to link the tariffs to soured ties between the two nations , suggesting a willingness to impose trade sanctions as a lever in pursuit of unrelated U.S. diplomatic goals . A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said Friday that Turkey has \u201c much to lose \u201d in continuing to hold Mr. Brunson .\nMr. Trump may also have been seeking to insulate the U.S. from any trade advantage Turkey could exploit from the currency drop .\n\u201c I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency , the Turkish Lira , slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar ! , \u201d the president wrote a few minutes before 9 a.m. Friday after the lira had dropped 14 % overnight against the dollar . \u201c Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time ! \u201d he added .\nOver three decades of periodic currency storms , such as the early 1990s Mexican peso plunge , and the Asian crisis a few years later , \u201c the market \u2019 s underlying assumption was that the U.S. would try to be helpful \u201d during periods of extreme foreign-exchange volatility , said Shahab Jalinoos , head of global currency strategy at Credit Suisse Group . `` Now the market can no longer assume that . \u201d\nForeign-exchange collapses can be perilous for emerging markets , particularly when they have borrowed heavily in dollars and thus find it harder to repay those debts as their own currencies fall .\nWhite House and Treasury officials didn \u2019 t respond to requests for comment about the administration \u2019 s broader strategy toward global currency-market instability , or about the economic considerations behind the increased tariffs .\nUnder his \u201c America First \u201d platform , Mr. Trump has sought to reorient U.S. economic policies , breaking with a longstanding bipartisan consensus that Washington \u2019 s mission was to take the lead in expanding , strengthening and stabilizing commercial and financial ties across countries\u2014and that such globalization was broadly in America \u2019 s self-interest , even if it might disadvantage some U.S. industries or communities .\nMr. Trump has challenged that orthodoxy , arguing that such policies have undermined American economic strength . He has revived long-dormant policies to block imports he considers threatening to the U.S. , and brushed aside warnings that such moves could harm the global trading system . He has argued that the U.S. should do more to use its economic and financial clout to force other countries to change policies he considers unfair to the U.S .\nThe tariffs that Mr. Trump said he was doubling were imposed earlier this year , not just on Turkey but on virtually every metals exporter around the world . The administration imposed tariffs of 25 % on steel and 10 % on aluminum by invoking a little-used Cold War-era law that allows presidents to block imports he deems a threat to American \u201c national security . \u201d\nMr. Trump \u2019 s broad use of that power provoked outrage from trading partners around the world , who said it violated World Trade Organization limits on such unilateral trade curbs and hit allies who posed no threat to U.S. security . Turkey is an ally and member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .\nMany countries retaliated with their own tariffs on U.S. exports .

        "content_original": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump\u2019s decision to double steel tariffs on Turkey as its government battled a currency collapse marked a departure for the U.S. from how it traditionally handles financial turmoil hitting emerging markets.\n\nWashington has generally tried to calm global markets in such moments, especially when investors are gripped by fear of contagion. Mr. Trump instead squeezed Ankara further, raising tariffs on Turkish steel imports to 50% and aluminum to 20%, which deepened the Turkish lira\u2019s drop and worsened market fears that its banks could be shaken.\n\nAdministration officials didn\u2019t clarify Mr. Trump\u2019s motives. The move followed a series of actions the Trump administration has taken in recent weeks to step up economic pressure on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to release American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson.\n\nThe doubled tariffs weren\u2019t related to Mr. Brunson, administration officials said Friday. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the tariffs were meant to protect the U.S. on national-security grounds, \u201cindependent of negotiations on trade or any other matter.\u201d\n\nIn a formal proclamation of the move issued Friday night\u2014nearly 12 hours after the president first announced it on Twitter\u2014the White House said the action was taken because the original global tariffs hadn\u2019t done as much as the administration had desired to boost domestic production of steel and aluminum. The statement didn\u2019t explain why Turkey alone was hit with the higher tariffs.\n\nIn his tweet, Mr. Trump seemed to link the tariffs to soured ties between the two nations, suggesting a willingness to impose trade sanctions as a lever in pursuit of unrelated U.S. diplomatic goals. A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said Friday that Turkey has \u201cmuch to lose\u201d in continuing to hold Mr. Brunson.\n\nMr. Trump may also have been seeking to insulate the U.S. from any trade advantage Turkey could exploit from the currency drop.\n\n\u201cI have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!,\u201d the president wrote a few minutes before 9 a.m. Friday after the lira had dropped 14% overnight against the dollar. \u201cOur relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u201d he added.\n\nOver three decades of periodic currency storms, such as the early 1990s Mexican peso plunge, and the Asian crisis a few years later, \u201cthe market\u2019s underlying assumption was that the U.S. would try to be helpful\u201d during periods of extreme foreign-exchange volatility, said Shahab Jalinoos, head of global currency strategy at Credit Suisse Group. \"Now the market can no longer assume that.\u201d\n\nForeign-exchange collapses can be perilous for emerging markets, particularly when they have borrowed heavily in dollars and thus find it harder to repay those debts as their own currencies fall.\n\nWhite House and Treasury officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the administration\u2019s broader strategy toward global currency-market instability, or about the economic considerations behind the increased tariffs.\n\nUnder his \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, Mr. Trump has sought to reorient U.S. economic policies, breaking with a longstanding bipartisan consensus that Washington\u2019s mission was to take the lead in expanding, strengthening and stabilizing commercial and financial ties across countries\u2014and that such globalization was broadly in America\u2019s self-interest, even if it might disadvantage some U.S. industries or communities.\n\nMr. Trump has challenged that orthodoxy, arguing that such policies have undermined American economic strength. He has revived long-dormant policies to block imports he considers threatening to the U.S., and brushed aside warnings that such moves could harm the global trading system. He has argued that the U.S. should do more to use its economic and financial clout to force other countries to change policies he considers unfair to the U.S.\n\nThe tariffs that Mr. Trump said he was doubling were imposed earlier this year, not just on Turkey but on virtually every metals exporter around the world. The administration imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum by invoking a little-used Cold War-era law that allows presidents to block imports he deems a threat to American \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s broad use of that power provoked outrage from trading partners around the world, who said it violated World Trade Organization limits on such unilateral trade curbs and hit allies who posed no threat to U.S. security. Turkey is an ally and member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nMany countries retaliated with their own tariffs on U.S. exports. Among them was Turkey, which in June put import taxes on $1.8 billion worth of U.S. coal, paper, walnuts, tobacco and other products.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s mention of the Turkish lira\u2019s plunge suggested a willingness to tolerate the currency\u2019s collapse.\n\nFollowing Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, the lira fell another 9% and then recovered some of its losses. Turkey\u2019s currency woes have stoked instability in other emerging markets such as South Africa, Hungary and Russia, as investors worry about similar fragility there. It also jolted European stocks and the euro, as investors focused on the possible costs to European banks holding Turkish debt.\n\n\u201cIf a crisis were to emerge somewhere in the world with the possibility of contagion, what is President Trump\u2019s response going to be? Cooperation with the world and showing leadership? Or more tariffs?\u201d said Chad Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a frequent critic of the administration\u2019s trade strategy. \u201cThis was not a good sign.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration did in June agree to back a $50 billion International Monetary Fund bailout of Argentina at a time when many investors worried that country\u2019s woes could trigger broader regional or global instability.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tweet also suggests the possibility of new terrain for administration trade policy\u2014the use of higher tariffs as a response to the weakening of a trading partner\u2019s currency.\n\nSome traders and economists read Mr. Trump\u2019s statement as indicating that the higher tariffs were designed to offset the impact of the weaker lira, since the cheaper Turkish currency would make Turkish steel and aluminum exports cheaper when sold in the U.S., offsetting much of the intended impact of the tariffs.\n\nSome free-trade critics have for years urged presidents to use tariffs as a weapon when exporters in other countries reap a windfall from currency devaluations.

In the summer of 2013 , he moved from Texas to Tennessee so his family could be closer to his wife \u2019 s parents . But when his new job evaporated with a layoff after just four months , Mr. Parkes was in trouble : unemployed in a difficult job market , edging toward age 50 , and with two kids moving through school .\nNot least among his challenges : He was still a newcomer to the Nashville area , with few friends or connections to turn to for support . \u201c I was basically terrified , because I didn \u2019 t know anyone here , \u201d he says .\nEven with his wife working in youth ministry , the year that followed was one of emotional turmoil . Parkes tried it all . Temp work . Networking with other parents at his kids \u2019 school . Contacting former employers . Mining online job boards . Each week , more r\u00e9sum\u00e9s went out into the void .\nThen this past fall , something changed . First came a small regional bank that actually wanted to interview him . Not long after came a call from the very bank that had laid him off . It was starting a new flood insurance underwriting division and hired Parkes to be part of the team .\nThe job means new confidence and financial security for Parkes and his family . It also represents a larger story of employment revival in the US economy .\nToday \u2019 s US job market is healthier than you might realize . True , the recovery is incomplete . Even a good job market today won \u2019 t mean conditions are easy for US workers .\nYet the progress is real . And crucially , it \u2019 s helping to address one of the defining features of the Great Recession and its aftermath : the large number of people who are long-term unemployed and in many cases at risk of dropping out of the workforce altogether .\nAn improved job climate has , more broadly , revived economic spirits across America . For the first time since the Great Recession officially ended some 5-1/2 years ago , Gallup and CNN polls find a majority of Americans having a positive view of the economy .\nLast year saw the strongest US employment growth since 1999 , and the official US unemployment rate has fallen to 5.7 percent of the labor force as of January , down from 6.6 percent a year before .\n\u201c It \u2019 s certainly good news that payroll growth has eliminated a lot of the employment gap that resulted from the recession , \u201d says Andrew Levin , who is joining the economics faculty of Dartmouth College . \u201c But at the current pace of job creation , another 18 months to two years will probably be needed to reach full employment . \u201d\nIn fact , even as the undeniable gains give the United States lower joblessness than many European nations , the set of remaining challenges is also clear :\n\u2022 Middle-class incomes had been stagnating and inequality widening even before the recession . Those trends have now become central political questions , gaining attention from Republican and Democratic leaders alike in the run-up to a presidential election in 2016 .\n\u2022 From robots to smart phones , technology has opened new opportunities for consumers but is also disrupting traditional occupations . Economist Tyler Cowen distilled the worry in a 2013 book , \u201c Average Is Over , \u201d forecasting a future in which an educated elite pulls increasingly far ahead of everyone else .\n\u2022 As the US emerges from the most protracted jobs bust since the Great Depression , a historically high number of working-age civilians are still without work or underemployed . Some have part-time jobs rather than the full-time ones they hope for . Some have grown so discouraged that they \u2019 ve stopped even looking for work .\nOne key worry is that many of the recession-sidelined Americans have become so detached from the workforce \u2013 losing skills , connections , marketability \u2013 that they may never work again .\nReviving the rate of labor force participation ( the share of US adults who are working or wanting to work ) may be a vital measure of whether America is really nearing \u201c full employment. \u201d That \u2019 s why , at this point , a month in which the unemployment rate edges up isn \u2019 t necessarily a bad thing \u2013 if it \u2019 s a sign of more people being drawn into the job hunt .\nEconomist Stephen Rose of George Washington University sees the challenges , but he also cautions against buying into a view of long-term pessimism . Time and again , he says , forecasts of a grim future have emerged in times of economic distress , technological change , or global competition \u2013 and then been proved wrong .\nAlready , in at least a few industries , a shortage of workers is starting to surface . Tim Bowe , chief executive of a product-development firm based near Boston , says the college- and graduate-degree scientists he \u2019 s looking to hire are hard to find .\n\u201c The market is not even tightening , \u201d he says . \u201c It \u2019 s tight . \u201d\nThe company , called Foliage , hopes to grow its 600-person US workforce by 20 percent this year as it brings technology solutions to clients in industries from cars to industrial equipment .\nEven beyond strong fields like math and sciences , employers have been adding jobs lately across a broad range of industries . The new positions include many low-paid ones in restaurants and retail shops . But many are also in professional services , sales , and skilled factory work . Fully 1 in 10 new jobs over the past year has come in construction , a welcome revival for an industry that was hit especially hard by the recession .\nThe job gains have actually been coming since the end of 2010 \u2013 and slower than anyone wished . But last year saw a pickup in the pace , a shift toward the better in public opinion about the economy , and forecasts of continued job creation in 2015 .\nEven states such as Michigan and Ohio have seen high unemployment rates plummet , in part because of a revival of automotive and other manufacturing . And in 28 states , led by many west of the Mississippi , employment is now back above 2007 levels .\nYoung people between 16 and 24 years old , actually , have been the age group whose connections to work have most frayed since 2008 . Their rate of participation in the labor force took a drop after the recession that was twice as big as the drop for workers ages 25 to 34 or ages 45 to 54 .\nNow that is changing . Rashid Nelson , a senior at Boston University , says he \u2019 s seen the job outlook improving steadily each year he \u2019 s been in college . And now he knows he has a job waiting , as an account manager for AT & T , selling telecommunication technologies to both small and large businesses .\n\u201c I just wanted to put myself in a good position , \u201d he says of his intensive job hunt last fall . \u201c I didn \u2019 t want to be that one student who graduated and didn \u2019 t know what he was doing . \u201d\nThat focus , not just an improved job market , contributed to his finding a position . He majored in an area that \u2019 s in demand ( marketing ) , planned carefully ( leaving his Fridays clear of classes for potential travel for job interviews ) , and kept sending out applications during fall semester .\nToday , as a student ambassador for Boston University \u2019 s Center for Career Development , he \u2019 s urging peers to do similar planning .\nOlder workers , too , are glad to see an improving employment climate . Sam Jarman of San Diego went through a long stint of unemployment \u2013 twice . Working in the mortgage industry , an epicenter of the financial crisis , he lost one job in 2008 . He found another in 2009 , making loan modifications for people at risk of foreclosure .\nIt was a high-level job ( managing other managers on the team ) but his job security was inversely related to the health of the economy . By early last year he was laid off again .\nThe business of making regular home loans was picking up , but he was 51 years old and says no one would hire him . \u201c They said , \u2018 You \u2019 ve been out of the origination side for five years and a lot has changed . We want to hire someone who has more recent experience . \u2019 \u201d\nCall it wisdom or desperation , Mr. Jarman began widening his efforts . \u201c I prayed , I networked , I was ready to take anything . I looked in health care , at Petco , Jack in the Box , \u201d he says . \u201c For the first time in 27 years , I considered leaving California because there were no jobs here . \u201d\nBut in October he landed one , in the lending industry and at a local credit union . He took a 25 percent pay cut and is one step down from his prior managerial level , but he \u2019 s glad to be there . \u201c I like it . There are good people here , and [ the company ] isn \u2019 t going to leave San Diego , \u201d he says . \u201c I feel more secure . \u201d\nAs of January , the Bureau of Labor Statistics still counts 2.8 million Americans as unemployed for more than half a year and still looking for work . Even when people do move forward , it \u2019 s not unusual for the process to be start-and-stop \u2013 with new jobs that don \u2019 t last very long .\nThe positive thing is simply this : From blue-collar workers to people like Jarman , more and more jobless workers are finding their way back to work .\nOne day last fall , Lidia Sotomayor was doing a dress rehearsal for that pivotal few minutes that could make or break her future \u2013 a job interview .\nHer mock interviewer , a woman from a group called Platform to Employment , was in effect the drill sergeant in a boot camp for the long-term unemployed . ( \u201c They coddled you for the first hour , \u201d Ms. Sotomayor recalls of the five-week intensive program . )\nSotomayor fought through the tough questions , drawing on her training . Don \u2019 t be intimidated . Pause to think , but not for too long . In the end , the room of about two dozen other jobless people erupted in applause at her performance .\nThe rehearsal , and the confidence boost , soon bore fruit . She now has a job as a bookkeeper in a small company , based in her home city of Bridgeport , Conn. , that makes electric cable assemblies for business clients .\nHer story offers a window on how today \u2019 s job market , though reviving , remains tougher than before the recession \u2013 and is being transformed by evolving technology .\nSotomayor was coached on how to craft a profile on the website LinkedIn and how that would help . She learned how companies are besieged by electronic job applications \u2013 and quickly weed through them in ways that winnow out lots of viable candidates .\nJoseph Carbone , who heads the organization that created Platform to Employment , says the challenges for workers are long term as well as partly cyclical .\n\u201c The days of getting a job and staying there for the rest of your working life , and not blending in any additional education or training \u2013 they \u2019 re gone , they \u2019 re over , \u201d he says . Managing one \u2019 s career means \u201c you \u2019 ve got to be vigilant . \u201d\nAs Mr. Carbone describes it , employers are simply warier of making a full-time hire than they used to be . If they can meet a workplace need with part-timers , temp workers , or contractors , that takes financial and regulatory liabilities off their shoulders . When they do hire full-timers , it comes with the expectation of continuous advancement in skills .\nThese aren \u2019 t new trends . \u201c Lifelong learning \u201d was becoming more than just a catchphrase even in the 1990s . But workplace change has accelerated . Switching jobs is fine , but being unemployed can quickly make one \u2019 s skills look out of date \u2013 not to mention being a financial drain .\nSotomayor says the training program hammered home a simple message : \u201c Stop the bleed \u201d by getting reemployed , even at a lower salary . If a new job isn \u2019 t within reach , Carbone urges people to do something to show they \u2019 re active \u2013 taking courses or volunteering , for instance . Such lessons apply to young and old alike .\nMr. Nelson , the soon-to-be college grad , is already steeped in the notion that he should keep his eye more than a few steps down the career trail . He has a long-term goal to build experience toward working as a sports marketing agent in professional basketball .\nAs more Americans who want jobs find them , they are shifting from belt-tightening to a new sense of confidence and new possibilities .\nA job doesn \u2019 t define a person , after all , but for millions it does contribute to everything from their sense of purpose to their ability to help a charity or a neighbor in need .\nFor Andre Miles near Chicago , a job means something as simple as being able to treat his young children to a night of special fun .\n\u201c I \u2019 m taking the whole family to Chuck E. Cheese \u2019 s tonight , \u201d he says by phone as he commutes homeward from his customer service job toward his wife and three young kids . That \u2019 s the kind of thing that had been cut out of the family budget in late 2012 , when his old job moved to Atlanta and he decided to stay in Illinois .\nAfter a long time out of work , Mr . Miles landed a job in December with an assist from a group called Skills for Chicagoland \u2019 s Future . \u201c I have something to offer , \u201d Miles says , referring to his skills in customer service . But jobs are also allowing him and his wife to pursue possible new paths through additional schooling .\nRandy Candelaria , who lives near Salt Lake City , found that getting a paycheck opened an even bigger door of opportunity : the potential to reconnect with his family and leave homelessness behind . His job is paying for a cellphone , which in turn has put him back in touch with his daughter and grandsons , ages 4 and 6 .\nAfter two years without work and living in homeless shelters and at friends \u2019 homes , Mr. Candelaria considers his new employment at a custom countertop company an amazing breakthrough . For workers like him , with prison time in their past , the job market is tougher than for most .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard when you make mistakes and you wish you could go back and \u2018 would have , should have , could have , \u2019 \u201d he says . \u201c Because of those choices , I have consequences , but it \u2019 s nice to know there are still programs and people who are willing to help . \u201d\nHelp came for him when he stopped in at the Utah Department of Workforce Services on a day when the office was uncommonly empty . He was just there to use the fax machine , not to do any prospecting . Still , he had registered with the agency , and began talking to employees who mentioned a job that was a possible fit for him . One phone call later , he had an interview \u2013 and later a job .\nIn Tennessee , Parkes no longer winces when he meets other parents who ask what he does for a living . The family budget has also expanded . While he was unemployed , the couple had shopped only at discount grocery stores , skipped getting health and dental insurance for themselves , and relied on help from family members and their church .\nNow Parkes can focus on paying down his debts and looking more than a month down the financial road for himself and his family .\nAfter persisting in maintaining a positive attitude through it all , Parkes also says the year of joblessness has put material success in perspective .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\u201c I was talking with my son the other day about wealth and I asked him to define what being rich means , \u201d he says . \u201c To me , you just need a place to live . A place that keeps you warm at night , keeps you cool in the summer . Not being tied to debt \u2013 that \u2019 s what it means to be rich . \u201d\nContributing to this report were Carolyn Abate in San Francisco , Eilene Zimmerman in San Diego , Emiley Morgan in Salt Lake City , and Michael Holtz in Boston .",

And in 28 states, led by many west of the Mississippi, employment is now back above 2007 levels.\n\nThis is welcome news for workers of all ages.\n\nYoung people between 16 and 24 years old, actually, have been the age group whose connections to work have most frayed since 2008. Their rate of participation in the labor force took a drop after the recession that was twice as big as the drop for workers ages 25 to 34 or ages 45 to 54.\n\nNow that is changing. Rashid Nelson, a senior at Boston University, says he\u2019s seen the job outlook improving steadily each year he\u2019s been in college. And now he knows he has a job waiting, as an account manager for AT&T, selling telecommunication technologies to both small and large businesses.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to put myself in a good position,\u201d he says of his intensive job hunt last fall. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be that one student who graduated and didn\u2019t know what he was doing.\u201d\n\nThat focus, not just an improved job market, contributed to his finding a position. He majored in an area that\u2019s in demand (marketing), planned carefully (leaving his Fridays clear of classes for potential travel for job interviews), and kept sending out applications during fall semester.\n\nToday, as a student ambassador for Boston University\u2019s Center for Career Development, he\u2019s urging peers to do similar planning.\n\nOlder workers, too, are glad to see an improving employment climate. Sam Jarman of San Diego went through a long stint of unemployment \u2013 twice. Working in the mortgage industry, an epicenter of the financial crisis, he lost one job in 2008. He found another in 2009, making loan modifications for people at risk of foreclosure.\n\nIt was a high-level job (managing other managers on the team) but his job security was inversely related to the health of the economy. By early last year he was laid off again.\n\nThe business of making regular home loans was picking up, but he was 51 years old and says no one would hire him. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019ve been out of the origination side for five years and a lot has changed. We want to hire someone who has more recent experience.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCall it wisdom or desperation, Mr. Jarman began widening his efforts. \u201cI prayed, I networked, I was ready to take anything. I looked in health care, at Petco, Jack in the Box,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the first time in 27 years, I considered leaving California because there were no jobs here.\u201d\n\nBut in October he landed one, in the lending industry and at a local credit union. He took a 25 percent pay cut and is one step down from his prior managerial level, but he\u2019s glad to be there. \u201cI like it. There are good people here, and [the company] isn\u2019t going to leave San Diego,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel more secure.\u201d\n\nAs of January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics still counts 2.8 million Americans as unemployed for more than half a year and still looking for work. Even when people do move forward, it\u2019s not unusual for the process to be start-and-stop \u2013 with new jobs that don\u2019t last very long.\n\nThe positive thing is simply this: From blue-collar workers to people like Jarman, more and more jobless workers are finding their way back to work.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nOne day last fall, Lidia Sotomayor was doing a dress rehearsal for that pivotal few minutes that could make or break her future \u2013 a job interview.\n\nHer mock interviewer, a woman from a group called Platform to Employment, was in effect the drill sergeant in a boot camp for the long-term unemployed. (\u201cThey coddled you for the first hour,\u201d Ms. Sotomayor recalls of the five-week intensive program.)\n\nSotomayor fought through the tough questions, drawing on her training. Don\u2019t be intimidated. Pause to think, but not for too long. In the end, the room of about two dozen other jobless people erupted in applause at her performance.\n\nThe rehearsal, and the confidence boost, soon bore fruit. She now has a job as a bookkeeper in a small company, based in her home city of Bridgeport, Conn., that makes electric cable assemblies for business clients.\n\nHer story offers a window on how today\u2019s job market, though reviving, remains tougher than before the recession \u2013 and is being transformed by evolving technology.\n\nSotomayor was coached on how to craft a profile on the website LinkedIn and how that would help. She learned how companies are besieged by electronic job applications \u2013 and quickly weed through them in ways that winnow out lots of viable candidates.\n\nJoseph Carbone, who heads the organization that created Platform to Employment, says the challenges for workers are long term as well as partly cyclical.\n\n\u201cThe days of getting a job and staying there for the rest of your working life, and not blending in any additional education or training \u2013 they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re over,\u201d he says. Managing one\u2019s career means \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be vigilant.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Carbone describes it, employers are simply warier of making a full-time hire than they used to be. If they can meet a workplace need with part-timers, temp workers, or contractors, that takes financial and regulatory liabilities off their shoulders. When they do hire full-timers, it comes with the expectation of continuous advancement in skills.\n\nThese aren\u2019t new trends. \u201cLifelong learning\u201d was becoming more than just a catchphrase even in the 1990s. But workplace change has accelerated. Switching jobs is fine, but being unemployed can quickly make one\u2019s skills look out of date \u2013 not to mention being a financial drain.\n\nSotomayor says the training program hammered home a simple message: \u201cStop the bleed\u201d by getting reemployed, even at a lower salary. If a new job isn\u2019t within reach, Carbone urges people to do something to show they\u2019re active \u2013 taking courses or volunteering, for instance. Such lessons apply to young and old alike.\n\nMr. Nelson, the soon-to-be college grad, is already steeped in the notion that he should keep his eye more than a few steps down the career trail. He has a long-term goal to build experience toward working as a sports marketing agent in professional basketball.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAs more Americans who want jobs find them, they are shifting from belt-tightening to a new sense of confidence and new possibilities.\n\nA job doesn\u2019t define a person, after all, but for millions it does contribute to everything from their sense of purpose to their ability to help a charity or a neighbor in need.\n\nFor Andre Miles near Chicago, a job means something as simple as being able to treat his young children to a night of special fun.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the whole family to Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s tonight,\u201d he says by phone as he commutes homeward from his customer service job toward his wife and three young kids. That\u2019s the kind of thing that had been cut out of the family budget in late 2012, when his old job moved to Atlanta and he decided to stay in Illinois.\n\nAfter a long time out of work, Mr. Miles landed a job in December with an assist from a group called Skills for Chicagoland\u2019s Future. \u201cI have something to offer,\u201d Miles says, referring to his skills in customer service. But jobs are also allowing him and his wife to pursue possible new paths through additional schooling.\n\nRandy Candelaria, who lives near Salt Lake City, found that getting a paycheck opened an even bigger door of opportunity: the potential to reconnect with his family and leave homelessness behind. His job is paying for a cellphone, which in turn has put him back in touch with his daughter and grandsons, ages 4 and 6.\n\nAfter two years without work and living in homeless shelters and at friends\u2019 homes, Mr. Candelaria considers his new employment at a custom countertop company an amazing breakthrough. For workers like him, with prison time in their past, the job market is tougher than for most.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you make mistakes and you wish you could go back and \u2018would have, should have, could have,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cBecause of those choices, I have consequences, but it\u2019s nice to know there are still programs and people who are willing to help.\u201d\n\nHelp came for him when he stopped in at the Utah Department of Workforce Services on a day when the office was uncommonly empty. He was just there to use the fax machine, not to do any prospecting. Still, he had registered with the agency, and began talking to employees who mentioned a job that was a possible fit for him. One phone call later, he had an interview \u2013 and later a job.\n\nIn Tennessee, Parkes no longer winces when he meets other parents who ask what he does for a living. The family budget has also expanded. While he was unemployed, the couple had shopped only at discount grocery stores, skipped getting health and dental insurance for themselves, and relied on help from family members and their church.\n\nNow Parkes can focus on paying down his debts and looking more than a month down the financial road for himself and his family.\n\nAfter persisting in maintaining a positive attitude through it all, Parkes also says the year of joblessness has put material success in perspective.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Not being tied to debt \u2013 that\u2019s what it means to be rich.\u201d\n\nContributing to this report were Carolyn Abate in San Francisco, Eilene Zimmerman in San Diego, Emiley Morgan in Salt Lake City, and Michael Holtz in Boston.",

They need to focus on the abundance of guns in the US and develop a suite of policies that directly tackle that issue , from licensing to confiscation to more aggressive bans of certain kinds of firearms\u2026 Just like Bernie Sanders helped launch discussions about single-payer and free college in 2016 , a push in 2020 could help get the party to where it needs to be on this issue if it really wants to address America \u2019 s gun problem. \u201d German Lopez , Vox\n\u201c There is one developed country\u2014and only one\u2014in which it is not only legal , but easy and convenient , to amass a private arsenal of mass slaughter .

Gun rights need to be protected , but the Second Amendment is not a suicide pact . \u201d\n\u201c Mass killings are increasing in frequency and have been since the 1980s . Not coincidentally , that was when the emptying out of state mental hospitals was at its peak . So what role does mental illness play in these mass killings ? Multiple studies done between 2000 and 2015 suggest that about a third of mass killers have an untreated severe mental illness . If mental illness is defined more broadly , the percentage is higher\u2026\n\u201c For those who are seriously mentally ill but who , because of their brain disease , are unaware of their illness and refuse treatment , it is sometimes necessary to require them to accept treatment as a condition for living in the community . This is often done under a program referred to as assisted outpatient treatment . Such treatment may involve injectable antipsychotic medication that can be effective for as long as three months . This should always be accompanied by a judicial process and legal protection of individual rights . We know what to do to reduce the number of mass killings associated with mental illness .

        "content_original": "Some suggest that Congress \u201cremove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again, Republicans cannot hide behind a claim that they are [the] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment.\u201d Edward B. Foley, Politico\n\n\u201cJust imagine a world where Democrats get everything leading candidates typically say they want on guns. Congress passes and President Elizabeth Warren signs a comprehensive bill that includes universal background checks, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and a red-flag law that lets law enforcement take away guns from dangerous people\u2026 \u201cIt almost certainly would not be enough. We would still likely see mass shootings, like the Gilroy, California, mass shooting, on a regular basis, in addition to the incidents of suicides, urban violence, and domestic abuse that are tragically even more common. That\u2019s because America would still have the weakest gun laws among developed nations, and it would still have the most firearms out of any country in the world \u2014 and the research has consistently found that places with more guns have more gun deaths\u2026 \u201c To change the status quo, Democrats should go big . They need to focus on the abundance of guns in the US and develop a suite of policies that directly tackle that issue, from licensing to confiscation to more aggressive bans of certain kinds of firearms\u2026 Just like Bernie Sanders helped launch discussions about single-payer and free college in 2016, a push in 2020 could help get the party to where it needs to be on this issue if it really wants to address America\u2019s gun problem.\u201d German Lopez, Vox\n\n\u201cThere is one developed country\u2014and only one\u2014in which it is not only legal, but easy and convenient, to amass a private arsenal of mass slaughter. That country also happens to be the one\u2014and the only one\u2014regularly afflicted by mass slaughters perpetrated by aggrieved individuals. You would not think that this is a complicated problem to puzzle out\u2026 \u201c[The list of mass shooters] offers a wide range of political points to score, if that is your wish. You will find here immigrants and natives; whites and nonwhites; Muslims and Christians; right-wingers, left-wingers, and the nonpolitical\u2026 Despite their diversity, all these killers had one thing in common: their uniquely American access to firearms\u2026 it is not because the U.S. is uniquely afflicted with either Islamic extremism or white nationalism that it suffers vastly more gun deaths than the rest of the developed world. America\u2019s uniquely bloodstained record of violence is a consequence of America\u2019s uniquely reckless attitudes toward weapons of mass death .\u201d David Frum, The Atlantic\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t strangers in our midst.

So far this year \u2014 and the weekend is not yet over \u2014 the Gun Violence Archive has recorded more than 8,734 people shot to death and more than 17,300 people wounded or otherwise injured in more than 33,000 incidents.

But the U.S. now has the most confirmed cases in the world, \"and the president has only recently seemed to realize the gravity of the situation.\" Because the federal government \"wasted so much time that we could have spent preparing\" and \"massively botched the rollout of testing for the virus,\" he said, our best shot at slowing this outbreak is strict social distancing.\n\nPresident Trump and some of his allies think the cost may be too high. \"I'm in no way minimizing the economic suffering caused by the shutdown,\" Oliver said. \"But the idea that people should sacrifice themselves for the economy is absurd.

Police officers shepherded back onlookers who got too close .\nThousands of tourists and pilgrims then walked the short distance to St Peter 's Square . They looked up to the balcony of the Basilica . Those at the back looked at video screens set up on either side of the square .\nThe crowd cheered as the Pope stepped out to deliver his Christmas message to the city and the world . He spoke quietly in Italian . He called for peace in a number of conflicts - in the Middle East and Africa in particular .\nThe Pope 's calls for peace are not new . Throughout the year , he delivers regular appeals for an end to conflict during his Sunday Angelus blessing given from the window of his official apartment in the Vatican .\nOn Christmas Day , the Pope makes the same call .

        "content_original": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pope Francis: \"Too many people are being held hostage or massacred\"\n\nPope Francis has denounced the \"brutal persecution\" of religious and ethnic minorities, in his traditional Christmas Day address.\n\nIn his second \"Urbi et Orbi\" - to the city and the world - Christmas message, the pontiff highlighted the plight of victims of conflict in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\"Too many people are being held hostage or massacred\" in Nigeria, he added.\n\nPope Francis also urged dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians and condemned Taliban attacks in Pakistan.\n\nTens of thousands of people turned out on St Peter's Square to hear the Argentine Pope deliver his annual message.\n\nHe said Christians in Iraq and Syria had endured conflict for too long, and \"together with those belonging to other ethnic and religious groups, are suffering a brutal persecution\".\n\n\"May Christmas bring them hope, as indeed also to the many displaced persons, exiles and refugees, children, adults and elderly, from this region and from the whole world,\" the Pope said.\n\nJames Reynolds, BBC News, Rome\n\nShortly before midday a marching band headed along the main avenue towards the Vatican. Police officers shepherded back onlookers who got too close.\n\nThousands of tourists and pilgrims then walked the short distance to St Peter's Square. They looked up to the balcony of the Basilica. Those at the back looked at video screens set up on either side of the square.\n\nThe crowd cheered as the Pope stepped out to deliver his Christmas message to the city and the world. He spoke quietly in Italian. He called for peace in a number of conflicts - in the Middle East and Africa in particular.\n\nThe Pope's calls for peace are not new. Throughout the year, he delivers regular appeals for an end to conflict during his Sunday Angelus blessing given from the window of his official apartment in the Vatican.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the Pope makes the same call. But his stage - and his audience - are much bigger.\n\nIn his Christmas Day address, he also asked for peace in Ukraine, Nigeria, in Libya, South Sudan and other parts of Africa.\n\nHe called for comfort for the families of the 132 children killed in a Taliban attack in Pakistan last week - and for the victims of the Ebola epidemic.\n\nOn Wednesday he made a surprise telephone call to refugees in a camp near Irbil, in Iraq's northern Kurdistan region.\n\n\"You are like Jesus on Christmas night.

He contended that this would not be as effective as opening as other, additional underutilized bands of spectrum.\n\nLawmakers and government officials in D.C. have made bridging the connectivity gap between rural and urban portions of America an increasingly large priority over the past year.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Over nearly four decades , Christine Blasey Ford , who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her , racked up a list of university degrees and professional accolades , including a Ph.D. in psychology , positions at Stanford University , a professorship and multiple academic publications .\nBut it is a day in 1982 , when the then-15-year-old prep school student attended a party with boys from a nearby boys school , that is destined to make Ford a household name .\nFord said Kavanaugh , 17 at the time , and a friend trapped her in a bedroom of a house in Montgomery County , Maryland , where the party was held . She said the friend watched while Kavanaugh tried to pull off her clothes . When she tried to yell , Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth to stop her , she said .\nThe friend jumped on top of them , knocking all three off the bed and allowing Ford to escape , she told The Washington Post in an interview posted Sunday night .\nKavanaugh denied the allegation , calling it `` completely false . '' In a statement Monday , he said , \u201c I have never done anything like what the accuser describes \u2013 to her or to anyone . ''\nBy Monday morning , a Wikipedia page about Ford had been created and the previously little-known biostatistician was the subject of dozens of articles and television reports , as well as a mocking Instagram post from President Donald Trump 's son , Donald Trump Jr. , written in crayon .\nFord and Kavanaugh are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday about the allegations . The hearings will delay a committee vote on Kavanaugh 's nomination and carry with them echoes of the testimony in 1991 of Anita Hill , who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his confirmation hearings to become a Supreme Court justice .\nThe sudden rush into the spotlight began very differently for Ford . In early July , she anonymously contacted the Post 's tip line when Kavanaugh made the shortlist of possible nominees for the Supreme Court position opened by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy .\nOn July 30 , Ford sent a confidential letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , via her congresswoman , Rep. Anna Eshoo , D-Calif. , in which she outlined the story about the possible nominee but asked for confidentiality .\nShe decided not to speak publicly over fears of what it would do to her and her family , she told the Post . She hired Debra Katz , a Washington lawyer whose firm focuses on whistle-blower , employment and sexual harassment laws .\nHer attempts to remain private failed , and the first reports of allegations involving Kavanaugh surfaced . Reporters called Ford , visited her home and attempted to speak to her as she left a class she taught .\nFord told the Post her `` civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation. \u201d She gave an on-the-record interview , which was published Sunday night .\nSince then , her online presence has both diminished and grown .

        "content_original": "Elizabeth Weise\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Over nearly four decades, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her, racked up a list of university degrees and professional accolades, including a Ph.D. in psychology, positions at Stanford University, a professorship and multiple academic publications.\n\nBut it is a day in 1982, when the then-15-year-old prep school student attended a party with boys from a nearby boys school, that is destined to make Ford a household name.\n\nFord said Kavanaugh, 17 at the time, and a friend trapped her in a bedroom of a house in Montgomery County, Maryland, where the party was held. She said the friend watched while Kavanaugh tried to pull off her clothes. When she tried to yell, Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth to stop her, she said.\n\nThe friend jumped on top of them, knocking all three off the bed and allowing Ford to escape, she told The Washington Post in an interview posted Sunday night.\n\nKavanaugh denied the allegation, calling it \"completely false.\" In a statement Monday, he said, \u201cI have never done anything like what the accuser describes \u2013 to her or to anyone.\"\n\nBy Monday morning, a Wikipedia page about Ford had been created and the previously little-known biostatistician was the subject of dozens of articles and television reports, as well as a mocking Instagram post from President Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., written in crayon.\n\nFord and Kavanaugh are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday about the allegations. The hearings will delay a committee vote on Kavanaugh's nomination and carry with them echoes of the testimony in 1991 of Anita Hill, who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his confirmation hearings to become a Supreme Court justice.\n\nThe sudden rush into the spotlight began very differently for Ford. In early July, she anonymously contacted the Post's tip line when Kavanaugh made the shortlist of possible nominees for the Supreme Court position opened by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nOn July 30, Ford sent a confidential letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., via her congresswoman, Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., in which she outlined the story about the possible nominee but asked for confidentiality.\n\nShe decided not to speak publicly over fears of what it would do to her and her family, she told the Post. She hired Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer whose firm focuses on whistle-blower, employment and sexual harassment laws.\n\nHer attempts to remain private failed, and the first reports of allegations involving Kavanaugh surfaced. Reporters called Ford, visited her home and attempted to speak to her as she left a class she taught.\n\nFord told the Post her \"civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation.\u201d She gave an on-the-record interview, which was published Sunday night.\n\nSince then, her online presence has both diminished and grown. She removed her LinkedIn profile but gained a Wikipedia page created by a stranger.\n\nThe researcher and scientist has led a low-key life until now. Ford, 51, is a professor and research psychologist who teaches research design and education clinical psychology at Palo Alto University and in a consortium program with Stanford University\u2019s School of Medicine.\n\nPalo Alto University in California is a professional school that offers undergraduate and graduate programs in psychology, counseling and research. The consortium program with Stanford\u2019s School of Medicine grants students a doctorate in clinical psychology. Ford's position was confirmed by the university.\n\nShe works with students on experimental and clinical trial design and data analysis, according to the university\u2019s website.\n\nBiostatisticians analyze data collected in medical or biological studies and use it to draw conclusions. They work with researchers and scientists to design medical experiments and human trials to ensure the results are scientifically valid and meaningful.\n\nMore:Delay vote on Brett Kavanaugh until we hear Christine Blasey Ford's testimony: Today's talker\n\nAlso:Kavanaugh accuser Christine Ford willing to testify before Senate committee, lawyer says\n\nRelated:Woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault speaks out in account published by Washington Post\n\nFord has numerous academic publications, under the name Christine Blasey, including a book on using statistical analysis in research, trauma symptom predictors after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and whether brain imaging in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder shows different responses in the recognition of emotion in people\u2019s faces.\n\nAccording to a since-deleted Linkedin profile reported by the San Jose Mercury News, Ford worked as a visiting professor at Pepperdine University and as a research psychologist at Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry.\n\nShe has an undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and a master\u2019s in psychology from Pepperdine University in California and in education from Stanford University.

        "content": "One factor that seems to be consistently true across states with the most and the least benefits is the political climate .\nPoliticians Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan recently introduced a plan to fight poverty by transferring more responsibility to the states . While the federal government offers various assistance programs to U.S. residents in need \u2014 anything from unemployment benefits to food stamps \u2014 the states provide additional services and benefits .\nRight now , the states already bear a substantial burden . They pay for public pension plans , unemployment insurance , education , Medicaid , and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program ( TANF ) , among other benefits . However , while most states fund many of these social programs , the amounts and levels they spend vary widely . 24/7 Wall St. identified the states that guaranteed the most benefits in these five categories , and the states that guaranteed the least .\nFor the most part , states that spent the most in one program tend to spent the most overall . Rhode Island , which ranked as the top-spending state this year , spent in the top 15 in all five measures we considered . Similarly , states that were close to the bottom of our list for doling out benefits and services spent less than average in nearly every spending category .\nHowever , this was not always the case . States like New York , which spent the most in the country on education per pupil and second-most in the country on Medicaid per enrollee , paid the fourth-lowest weekly unemployment benefits relative to lost wages .\nThe reasons some states spend more than others on benefits and programs is complicated . One factor that seems to be consistently true across the top and bottom spenders is the political climate . Of the 10 states that ranked as the most generous , nine voted Democratic in the last presidential election , with Alaska as the exceptions . Of the 10 states that spent the least on their social programs , all but one \u2014 Florida \u2014 voted Republican .\nThe political climate can also influence how much a state collects in taxes , with Democratic states collecting more than Republican states . States that spent more on benefits were also more likely to have higher median incomes , which mean that tax bases were also higher . In fact , all five of the states with the highest median income are among the top spenders on social programs . Most of the least generous states have among the lowest median incomes in the country .\nThere does not appear to be a relationship between the relative needs of a state 's residents for social programs and the state 's spending . Of the states that spent the most on weekly TANF cash assistance , for example , the vast majority had among the lowest poverty rates in the country .\nIn an interview with 24/7 Wall St , Michael Leachman , director of state fiscal research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ( CBPP ) , explained that it 's hard to explain why states that have a greater need for public assistance spend less , while states with better-off populations spend more on benefits . `` You wonder if it is n't to some extent a case of chicken-and-egg , '' he said . `` In the states that have urban , higher income populations\u2026 there 's money there , and the politics have evolved to encourage spending on public programs . But it is a difficult question to answer . ''\nIn order to assess how much or how little a state guarantees in benefits and services , 24/7 Wall St. examined spending by each state on a number of different programs . We considered average pension benefit payments per beneficiary as well as per pupil spending , both published by the Census Bureau for the 2011 fiscal year . Pension benefits include both state and local pensions , while per pupil spending reflects the total from all sources of funding .\nThe Department of Labor 's Employment & Training Administration provided unemployment insurance figures , calculated over a 12-month period ending in the third quarter of 2013 . Information on TANF figures is from the CBPP . Medicaid payments per enrollee for fiscal 2010 are from the Kaiser Family Foundation . While states receive partial federal funding for TANF and Medicaid , they have considerable discretion over how to implement these programs . All data used were for the most recent available year .\nVermont collected more taxes per resident in fiscal 2011 than all but three other states . At $ 8,988 per capita , the high tax revenue may help explain the state 's generous benefit programs that year . High state tax revenue \u2014 $ 8,988 per capita \u2014 may have helped account for Vermont 's generous benefit programs that year . In 2012 , just 6.5 % of Vermont 's population did n't have health insurance , less than half the national rate . And with Vermont officials pushing for universal coverage , health coverage in the state may improve even more . In 2011 , Governor Peter Shumlin signed into law Green Mountain Healthcare , a single-payer plan . The plan is expected to be fully implemented by 2017 .\nHawaii 's unemployment insurance system was the most generous in the country . Unemployed workers received an average benefit of nearly $ 423 , or 52.5 % of the average weekly wage , as of the third quarter of 2013 \u2014 both more than any other state . By either measure this was more than any other state . Hawaii also has a two-tiered system of TANF benefit levels , depending on the ability of a family member to work . Even the lower benefit level places Hawaii among the most generous states . Last year , the state also eliminated its asset limit , which had previously left many families unqualified for TANF due to their savings and other assets . Opponents of asset limit believe this discourages saving for emergencies .\nMaryland was one of the wealthiest states in the nation in 2012 , when a typical household earned more than $ 71,000 , the highest of any state . That year , just 10.8 % of residents lived below the poverty line , less than in all but four other states . Like most states , Maryland 's pension program took a hit during the recession , losing 20 % of its value in 2009 . As of the middle of last year , however , the fund had recovered substantially , exceeding $ 40 billion in value .\nBeneficiaries of Pennsylvania 's unemployment insurance program received more than $ 357 per week on average in 2013 , among the most in the country . Since the start of 2014 , Pennsylvania 's unemployed may have a rough time because federally funded unemployment compensation is ending for nearly 90,000 Pennsylvania residents . Pennsylvania was also a top spender on education as of fiscal 2011 . Total per pupil spending was $ 13,467 that year , nearly $ 3,000 more than the national average spending .\nNew Jersey was among the nation 's highest spenders on education as of fiscal 2011 , spending close to $ 16,000 per pupil . This was more than $ 6,000 per student above the national rate . On a per-student basis , the state was also among the highest spenders on both teachers and school system workers . That same year , the average state or local pension beneficiary received more than $ 29,000 per year , one of the largest average benefits in the U.S. During his tenure , Governor Chris Christie has pushed through reforms in both teacher tenure and pension spending . Christie recently began his second term as governor with a `` State of the State '' speech , in which he pushed further reforms to both education and state pensions . New Jersey was also a leader in Medicaid spending per enrollee , ranking third in the nation in fiscal 2010 .\nAlaskans paid more state taxes than any other state in 2011 . Considering their high incomes and the state 's low poverty rate , Alaska residents may have been able to afford it . Median household income in the state was $ 67,712 in 2012 , higher than all but two other states . Due in part to high taxes , the state 's revenue in 2011 was $ 17,630 per capita , by far the highest in the nation that year . During the 12 months through the third quarter of last year , however , Alaska 's unemployed received $ 250 per week , on average , relatively small compared to the rest of the U.S. Additionally , more than one in five people in Alaska did not have health insurance in 2012 , more than nearly any other state . Overall , however , Alaskans have access to very generous benefits . For families living in poverty , the federal food stamp program , together with Alaska 's welfare system , can cover families for more than 80 % of the federal poverty level and the highest combined benefit as of 2013 .\nMassachusetts had $ 6,832 per person in state revenue as of fiscal 2011 , more than all but eight other states . Much of this likely went to support the state 's various social safety net programs . Per pupil spending on K-12 schools was the seventh highest in the nation that year , while the average annual benefit payment to state and local pension beneficiaries was ninth-highest in the U.S . The state was also a high spender on Medicaid , paying $ 6,841 per enrollee as of fiscal 2010 , 12th most in the nation . However , this may have been in part due to the high cost of health care in the state . As of the most recent quarter , only care in Alaska was more expensive , according to MERIC . Despite the high health care costs , just 3.9 % of the state 's population did not have health insurance in 2012 , the lowest % age of any state . The state 's 2006 health care reforms , often considered a model for the ACA , are likely the reason for the high coverage rates in the state .\nConnecticut pension beneficiaries received generous payments in 2011 of more than $ 35,000 on average \u2014 the highest in the country . Connecticut was among the highest spenders on education in 2011 , spending more than $ 5,000 more per pupil than the national average . Teacher salaries and benefits were among the highest at that time as well . Connecticut residents were also among the wealthiest in the nation as of 2012 , with more than 11 % earning $ 200,000 or more per year , the highest proportion nationally .\nNew York was one of the top benefit spenders in the nation on a wide range of state programs . New York spent $ 8,910 per Medicaid enrollee in fiscal 2010 , trailing only Alaska . In 2012 , Governor Andrew Cuomo petitioned the federal government to allow the state to keep some of the billions of dollars its Medicaid redesign saved . However , a decision on whether to allow the state to reinvest this money within its own health system is pending . In addition to its high Medicaid expenses , New York also led the nation in per pupil spending as of fiscal 2011 , at more than $ 19,000 . TANF benefit levels were among the highest in the nation as well last year , due in part to a state program that includes a number of different components , including a variable amount for rent that well exceeds what some states give in TANF benefits . Of course , New York must also raise enough taxes to be able to provide these services . The state collected $ 3,500 in fiscal 2011 , eighth-most in the U.S .\nRhode Island was one of just six states to pay pension beneficiaries more than $ 30,000 in fiscal year 2011 ; the state paid $ 31,548 on average . In November 2011 , state legislators enacted the Retirement Security Act , which introduced considerable reforms to the state 's pension program . The act was designed to lower the state 's overall pension liabilities , which were projected to increase under the previous system . Rhode Islanders received another relatively generous benefit . The jobless received unemployment checks worth nearly 40 % of the typical weekly wage on average over the 12 months through the third quarter of last year , among the best compensation nationally .\nCLICK HERE : for a list of the 10 states with the least government benefits\n24/7 Wall St. is a \u2588\u2588\u2588 content partner offering financial news and commentary .

(Photo: The Rose Island Lighthouse)\n\nPoliticians Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan recently introduced a plan to fight poverty by transferring more responsibility to the states. While the federal government offers various assistance programs to U.S. residents in need \u2014 anything from unemployment benefits to food stamps \u2014 the states provide additional services and benefits.\n\nRight now, the states already bear a substantial burden. They pay for public pension plans, unemployment insurance, education, Medicaid, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF), among other benefits. However, while most states fund many of these social programs, the amounts and levels they spend vary widely. 24/7 Wall St. identified the states that guaranteed the most benefits in these five categories, and the states that guaranteed the least.\n\nFor the most part, states that spent the most in one program tend to spent the most overall. Rhode Island, which ranked as the top-spending state this year, spent in the top 15 in all five measures we considered. Similarly, states that were close to the bottom of our list for doling out benefits and services spent less than average in nearly every spending category.\n\nHowever, this was not always the case. States like New York, which spent the most in the country on education per pupil and second-most in the country on Medicaid per enrollee, paid the fourth-lowest weekly unemployment benefits relative to lost wages.\n\nThe reasons some states spend more than others on benefits and programs is complicated. One factor that seems to be consistently true across the top and bottom spenders is the political climate. Of the 10 states that ranked as the most generous, nine voted Democratic in the last presidential election, with Alaska as the exceptions. Of the 10 states that spent the least on their social programs, all but one \u2014 Florida \u2014 voted Republican.\n\nThe political climate can also influence how much a state collects in taxes, with Democratic states collecting more than Republican states. States that spent more on benefits were also more likely to have higher median incomes, which mean that tax bases were also higher. In fact, all five of the states with the highest median income are among the top spenders on social programs. Most of the least generous states have among the lowest median incomes in the country.\n\nThere does not appear to be a relationship between the relative needs of a state's residents for social programs and the state's spending. Of the states that spent the most on weekly TANF cash assistance, for example, the vast majority had among the lowest poverty rates in the country.\n\nIn an interview with 24/7 Wall St, Michael Leachman, director of state fiscal research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), explained that it's hard to explain why states that have a greater need for public assistance spend less, while states with better-off populations spend more on benefits. \"You wonder if it isn't to some extent a case of chicken-and-egg,\" he said. \"In the states that have urban, higher income populations\u2026 there's money there, and the politics have evolved to encourage spending on public programs.

The Joint List, an alliance of Arab parties, was in third place, the ultra-Orthodox Shas party fourth, and Yisrael Beiteinu, a nationalist party, fifth.\n\nThe CEC tally does not say how this translates into seats in the Knesset.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nBased on the projections by Israeli media, neither Mr Gantz nor Mr Netanyahu would be able to form a majority coalition without support from Yisrael Beiteinu.\n\nIts leader, Avigdor Lieberman, reiterated on Wednesday that he would only support a unity government that included Likud and Blue and White.\n\nHowever, Mr Gantz has ruled out sitting with Likud if it is led by Mr Netanyahu because the prime minister is facing charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three corruption cases, pending a final hearing next month.\n\nMr Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.\n\nNetanyahu weakened\n\nAnalysis by Tom Bateman, BBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem\n\nThe prime minister is well short of being able to form a governing bloc of right-wing and religious parties that are prepared to sit with him. In fact the result leaves him in an even weaker position than he was after April's vote.\n\nIt's almost impossible to predict the outcome, with frenetic horse trading on the way and even the chance of parties fragmenting or politicians shifting allegiances. But as it stands, three broad themes seem among the possibilities:\n\nA dominant new governing bloc of the two big rival parties: Likud with Blue and White. This only seems possible without Mr Netanyahu as Likud leader. Needless to say that's a deal breaker for him and, so far at least, for his party\n\nMr Netanyahu's political rival Avigdor Lieberman miraculously changes his mind and agrees to join a right-wing and religious Netanyahu government - something his voters understood would never happen\n\nA third election - which nobody here has an appetite for\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Netanyahu stays on, but watch this space. For a few weeks.\n\nIn a speech to supporters at a post-election rally in Tel Aviv late on Tuesday, Mr Gantz said he wanted to form a \"broad unity government that will express the will of the people\" and \"start the journey of repairing Israeli society\".\n\n\"We will begin negotiations and I will speak with everyone,\" he added.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Avigdor Lieberman says he wants a \"broad, liberal, national government\"\n\nThe former military chief said he would reach out to Yisrael Beitenu and the left-wing Labour-Gesher and Democratic Camp parties. He did not mention the Joint List, which is unlikely to sit in any Israeli government, but later spoke by telephone with its leader Ayman Odeh.\n\nAt a news conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday night, Mr Netanyahu said: \"There are only two options, a government led by me or a dangerous government dependent on the Arab parties.\"\n\nMr Lieberman prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after the last election in April because he refused to back down in a longstanding dispute with religious parties over exempting ultra-Orthodox young men from military service.",

His return to the post was largely expected after Mr. Obama tasked him late last year with leading the federal government's response to rebuilding coastal areas damaged by Superstorm Sandy.\n\nA spokesman said Mr. Donovan was \"honored\" that the president had asked him to stay on as HUD secretary. \"He looks forward to continuing his work with the president,\" said Alexander Wohl, the HUD spokesman.\n\nMr. Donovan played an important role shepherding a $25 billion settlement reached a year ago between 49 state attorneys general, five large U.S. banks and the Obama administration over foreclosure abuses. The administration has faced criticism for what many have called an ineffective response to the housing bust. Recent programs to boost refinancing for homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth have had more success. The housing crisis has elevated the HUD secretary's role. One of Mr. Donovan's top challenges has been managing the Federal Housing Administration, which is at risk of requiring taxpayer funding for the first time in its 79-year history. The agency insures mortgages with low down payments and has played a crucial role providing credit during the housing downturn. Rising losses on loans it backed as the housing boom turned to bust are threatening to wipe out thin reserves. The administration also has yet to say what it will do with mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Officials have completed a thorough review of how to structure a new federal guarantee for certain mortgages but haven't detailed its preferred plan publicly.

Pledges to scrap the nuclear programme have been made before by his predecessors.\n\nWhat could actually happen?\n\nIt's hard to say, but Mr Trump has signalled that they could sign an agreement to formally end the Korean War, which ended in a truce in 1953. Doing that would probably be \"the easy part\", he said.\n\nThe US president has also said that if he thinks things are going badly, he will walk out of the meeting, but if things go well, Mr Kim could receive an invitation to the White House.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.

The result is a feeling of relief from students , but also more economically and racially diverse freshman classes .\nFew things loom over American high school students more than college admissions tests . But a movement is accelerating across the United States , with more colleges giving students the choice of either submitting their SAT or ACT scores or not . Public and private colleges from Arizona to Illinois to Massachusetts \u2013 including some of the most elite \u2013 have adopted a test-optional model or are moving in that direction . It marks one of the biggest changes in college admissions in the past two decades .\nAfter classes and 4-H Club meetings and homework , Esmeralda Hernandez spent a portion of her spring semester junior year engaged in a nightly routine familiar to millions of American teens : logging on to a website to practice math , reading , and timed test-taking for the SAT .\nWhile she scored fairly well , she decided to study more over the summer and take the entrance exam a second time . Her hard work paid off : She earned the highest score in her small senior class in tiny Swainsboro , Georgia . But for a farmworker \u2019 s daughter whose college aspirations stretched beyond state lines , it still didn \u2019 t seem good enough .\nIn her home nestled in the woods on a dirt road , she kept looking longingly at a postcard sent by the University of Chicago , her top choice . What always caught her eye was the image of a coffee stain on the card , which , when looked at closely , showed the chemical formula for coffee . The quirky intellectualism behind the card only reinforced her desire to attend the elite university .\nYet she nearly gave up on her dream school , until she discovered it offered full scholarships \u2013 and the option of applying without submitting an SAT score . Suddenly , hope rushed back in , tinged with uncertainty .\n\u201c I thought that if I hid my test scores from the school , they would ask , what are you hiding ? \u201d she says . \u201c But it was also very freeing in the fact that I didn \u2019 t have to be defined by something that was only four hours and didn \u2019 t really , in my opinion , define who I was as a person . ... There were so many more things that reflected how intelligent or motivated I was . \u201d\nFew things in life loom over American high school students more than college admissions tests . After years of toiling to earn good grades , years of slogging through Advanced Placement courses , and years of participating in extracurricular activities to burnish their credentials , many students take a test that they \u2019 ve been told can either catapult or crush their college hopes .\nBut now a movement is accelerating across the country \u2013 with more colleges giving students the choice of either submitting their SAT or ACT scores or not . Public and private colleges from Arizona to Illinois to Massachusetts \u2013 including some of the most elite \u2013 have adopted a test-optional model or are moving toward it . It marks one of the biggest changes in college admissions in the past two decades .\nThe result is a feeling of relief \u2013 and liberation \u2013 among both high schoolers and parents , in competitive metropolises and quiet rural towns alike . Perhaps more important , the move is contributing to a profound shift in the way schools and society measure a person \u2019 s value . Instead of giving the impression that admissions is based largely on a single test score , more colleges now proclaim loudly that the totality of an individual \u2013 yes , the good grades earned , but also the person \u2019 s unique talents and character \u2013 is so important that a test score is no longer necessary .\nTest-optional institutions continue to accept scores from students who want to share them , as one marker of achievement , and an average of 75 % of their applicants still do . But the schools are breaking down some long-held notions about how to take stock of a student \u2019 s merit and likelihood of success \u2013 largely in the name of equity .\n\u201c What we do know about higher education is that it reproduces inequality ... and it \u2019 s good to try and destabilize that a little , \u201d says Elisabeth Clemens , a sociology professor at UChicago who was not involved in creating the new test-optional policy .\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201c What we do know about higher education is that it reproduces inequality ... and it \u2019 s good to try and destabilize that a little. \u201d \u2013 Elisabeth Clemens , a University of Chicago sociology professor\nThis neo-Gothic campus , the Midwest \u2019 s closest equivalent to an Ivy League school , caused a buzz in the summer of 2018 as the first top-ranked university to go test-optional .\nThe list of bachelor \u2019 s degree-granting institutions that de-emphasize the tests has grown to 1,060 since Bowdoin College in Brunswick , Maine , pioneered test-optional in 1969 . Today , more than half of the \u201c top 100 \u201d liberal arts colleges are on the list , the National Center for Fair & Open Testing ( FairTest ) reports , and about 50 joined in the past year .\nThe first student class to include \u201c nonsubmitters \u201d of test scores arrived at UChicago this fall . Professor Clemens says she can \u2019 t tell who they are when she asks a class of first-year students to \u201c wrestle with important arguments \u201d in centuries-old texts like Hobbes \u2019 \u201c Leviathan. \u201d She trusts that both types of applicants will thrive here , though she \u2019 ll keep an eye on research in the coming years on student performance .\nThe massive University of California system might be the next to go test-optional . Its Board of Regents had been considering dropping the SAT/ACT requirement even before students and a school district filed a recent lawsuit , claiming that the tests have a discriminatory effect because of racial and economic disparities .\nCalifornia could prove a \u201c tipping point , because it is the largest recipient of SAT scores in the country [ and ] it is viewed as the most prestigious public university system , \u201d says Robert Schaeffer , FairTest \u2019 s public education director .\nDamian Dovarganes/AP/File Students walk on the University of California , Los Angeles campus . A school district has sued the University of California system , trying to force it to stop requiring standardized tests for admission .\nYet the ubiquity of the tests suggests that their demise is far from inevitable . More than 2.2 million students in the high school class of 2019 took the SAT , and 1.8 million took the ACT . Many states require and pay for students to take one of the exams .\nThe nonprofit groups that own the tests push back vigorously against perceptions that they are unfair or put too much pressure on teenagers . Research has shown that when combined with high school GPA , the scores boost colleges \u2019 ability to predict GPA and the likelihood that first-year students will return for a second year . \u201c It \u2019 s a measuring tool . ... You can not blame the measurement for inequities or inequalities in society , \u201d says Marten Roorda , CEO of ACT , based in Iowa . Test makers use rigorous methods to ensure the test questions themselves are not biased , he says .\nThe SAT or ACT can provide opportunities for students , like Ms. Hernandez , whose talent otherwise might never have been discovered . Many colleges send out recruitment mailings to students with good scores who live in places their admissions officers don \u2019 t visit .\nAdvocates for the tests also say that high school GPAs are not comparable , because of highly localized school systems in the United States . Without a standardized benchmark like a test result , grade inflation could become a bigger problem , and \u201c wealthier students [ could ] game the system by having stronger letters of recommendation \u201d or other advantages , says Lynn Letukas , who formerly worked for the College Board ( which owns the SAT ) and co-edited the 2018 book \u201c Measuring Success : Testing , Grades , and the Future of College Admissions . \u201d\nThis storied Harry Potter-esque UChicago campus fringed with modern architecture is a whole new world for Ms. Hernandez . Ninety-two Nobel laureates have walked the same stone stairways and underground tunnels she scurries through between classrooms and libraries .\nJust as exciting to someone who used to have to drive for miles to get to Walmart , she can hop on her used olive-green bicycle and zip to class or a variety of stores in the Hyde Park community in a few minutes .\nBut the bike isn \u2019 t the only thing accelerating her . Attending UChicago is pushing her quickly up the social mobility ladder .\nAt one point , she thought all she could afford was to enroll in a state public university , where she could apply two years \u2019 worth of credit she earned at community college during her high school years .\nHer Mexican-immigrant parents didn \u2019 t attend college . And her only recent role model who left Swainsboro for an elite university was a family friend from church who went to Yale . But she felt encouraged by her small town \u2013 even the woman on the other side of the window where she went to pay her phone bill last summer asked about her plans .\nEyeing a major in political science and/or sociology , she says she \u2019 s grateful \u201c to meet a lot more interesting people who all worked hard throughout their four years to get to someplace like this . \u201d\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201c I thought that if I hid my test scores from the school , they would ask , what are you hiding ? But it was also very freeing in the fact that I didn \u2019 t have to be defined by something that was only four hours and didn \u2019 t really , in my opinion , define who I was as a person. \u201d \u2013 Esmeralda Hernandez , a student at the University of Chicago who didn \u2019 t submit her SAT scores in her admissions application\nShe \u2019 s sitting at a dark wooden table in Hutchinson Commons , an Oxford-inspired dining hall and student lounge , where the global mix of students contrasts with stately rows of UChicago presidential portraits lining the walls . But even indoors , the Peach State native is still wearing her beige knit cap to ward off the cold .\nHere she anticipates gaining insights from stellar professors , internships , and possibly a study-abroad trip to Paris or Barcelona . At a four-year school , she says , she can \u201c be a young adult for a while , rather than just getting two years of university experience and then jumping out into a career field . \u201d\nUChicago requires applicants to write two essays , one about why they want to attend the school , and one based on their choice of five topics . \u201c Can you read and write and think ? That \u2019 s going to be a big indicator of how you do here , \u201d says admissions officer Marjorie Betley .\nTest-optional swayed Ms. Hernandez to apply , but her ability to come also depended on a broader set of policies \u2013 including financial aid \u2013 to open up access for underrepresented students . In the first round of test-optional admissions , in the fall of 2019 , UChicago \u2019 s applications jumped 20 % overall . But they went up 60 % for rural students and 24 % for first-generation students .\nIn rural communities , \u201c there \u2019 s not a lot of test prep around there ... and a lot of students are driving two , three , four hours \u201d to get to an SAT or ACT test , says Ms. Betley , director of the university \u2019 s Emerging Rural Leaders Program . \u201c Testing has never been the most important part of our application process . ... What better way to stress that than to just take [ the requirement ] away . \u201d\nMs. Hernandez \u2019 s former school , Swainsboro High School , recently hosted a test-taking session for the ACT . Among the school \u2019 s 160 seniors , just over half typically go on to college \u2013 usually within Georgia , says counselor Monica Pace .\nThose applying for public universities or scholarships have to reach a minimum SAT/ACT score , and that can motivate students to work harder on math and reading , she says . One student aimed for a scholarship that requires a 1200 on the SAT . \u201c This recent test , she was so excited , \u201d says Ms. Pace .\n\u201c I think she \u2019 s taken it three times ; she finally got her score . \u201d\nFor parents like Pat Lynch , any move away from the pervasive presence of the SAT or ACT in high schoolers \u2019 lives is welcome . Just before noon on a crisp October Saturday , Ms. Lynch is browsing a catalog in the driver \u2019 s seat of her black Volvo , waiting for her daughter to emerge from the SAT at Nashua High School North in New Hampshire . Her daughter has already taken the SAT twice at her own Roman Catholic school , and the ACT once .\n\u201c She \u2019 s having a hard time getting a decent score , and she \u2019 s a smart kid \u2013 all A \u2019 s , great GPA , four years of math , four years of science \u2013 but these tests are a lot of pressure , \u201d Ms. Lynch says .\nShe thinks her daughter will apply without scores to the three out of five colleges on her list that are test-optional . Colleges are \u201c finding out that this SAT is a racket , \u201d she says .\nNot true , say the test makers . Since a new version rolled out in 2016 , the SAT has dropped \u201c all vestiges of the aptitude approach used to develop the early SAT 100 years ago , \u201d College Board spokesman Zachary Goldberg writes in an email . \u201c Gone are the infamous \u2018 SAT words , \u2019 penalties for guessing , and math that isn \u2019 t necessary for college work . \u201d\nMs. Hernandez acknowledges that her hours spent prepping on Khan Academy , an education platform that partners with the College Board to help applicants get ready to take the exam with a free online program , did some good . \u201c I learned certain techniques in algebra ... [ and ] I got a lot of critical reading training . ... I can read extremely fast and still take a lot of things in . \u201d\nBut the tests still feel like an unnecessary requirement to many students .\n\u201c Being good at standardized testing is being good at standardized testing , \u201d says a UChicago first-year student from California who asked to keep her name private .\nFreshman Daniel Gendy says he felt a lot of pressure to compare his test scores with those of other potential applicants on college online forums . The night before he sent in his UChicago application , he decided to check the test-optional box . \u201c I was involved with my high school \u2019 s founding of a robotics team , and I wanted that or other extracurriculars , such as fencing , to represent me , \u201d he says .\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201c I was involved with my high school \u2019 s founding of a robotics team , and I wanted that or other extracurriculars , such as fencing , to represent me. \u201d \u2013 Daniel Gendy , a freshman at the University of Chicago\nSome students think too much focus on testing can be a detriment to the academic culture .\n\u201c Schools are supposed to be about learning and education and just expanding your mind as much as possible , \u201d says fourth-year UChicago economics and philosophy major Max Marcussen , who hails from a rich Connecticut town where testing and tutoring go hand in hand . With test-optional admissions , the hope is that \u201c having less emphasis on test scores means that you can focus more here on what actually matters . \u201d\nSeveral weeks into her first quarter , Ms. Hernandez dropped her calculus class . She had tested into it , and plans to take it later , but she found that having the optional fourth class in her schedule left no time for extracurriculars . Now she \u2019 s enjoying the Model United Nations club and tutoring adults for the citizenship test .\nStudents here say the curriculum challenges everyone , and they get tremendous support from professors and peer tutors . But researchers have been curious about whether the academic outcomes at test-optional schools are different for those who don \u2019 t submit exam scores . A 2018 study of 28 large and small institutions found that nonsubmitters had marginally lower first-year and cumulative college GPAs than submitters . But nonsubmitters graduated at equivalent or slightly higher rates . The report , co-authored by a test-optional supporter , showed that first-generation , low-income , female , and underrepresented minority students were more strongly represented among those who didn \u2019 t submit test scores .\nSupporters of testing say the growth of diversity on these campuses can \u2019 t necessarily be linked to test-optional policies , because the schools often offer other incentives to students , including financial ones . To help schools with their diversity goals , the College Board recently added a feature called Landscape , which helps give a fuller portrait of who students are and where they come from by putting scores in the context of neighborhood and school demographic information .\nSAT and ACT scores \u201c can be a valuable indicator for certain students , \u201d says Peter Wilson , UChicago \u2019 s director of undergraduate admissions . \u201c If the students feel like it shows their intelligence or it shows how they \u2019 re doing , we would love them to send it in . I don \u2019 t think we would ever get rid of it or say we \u2019 re going to be test-blind . \u201d\nYet that \u2019 s exactly what testing critics in California want at public universities .\nUse of the SAT and ACT is \u201c morally impermissible ... and the admissions process should no longer be contaminated by this discriminatory metric , \u201d said Mark Rosenbaum , directing attorney at the nonprofit Public Counsel , in filing a lawsuit Dec. 10 against the University of California system on behalf of students and the Compton Unified School District .\nCalifornia data from 2019 show that 45 % of white students scored 1200 or above on the SAT , compared with 9 % of African American students and 12 % of Hispanics . The University of California \u2019 s Academic Senate had already begun considering removal of the test requirement and is expected to make recommendations within a few months .\nThe growing revolt over testing could bolster a backlash against another pillar of the higher education establishment \u2013 testing-based merit aid . Some colleges , such as Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI ) in Massachusetts , have already stopped considering test scores when handing out discretionary scholarships .\nBreaking down the connection between \u201c so-called merit scholarships \u201d and SAT/ACT scores is \u201c the next frontier to broaden accessibility to higher education , \u201d says FairTest \u2019 s Mr. Schaeffer .\nAdmissions shifted to test-optional at WPI in 2007 . Since then , the school has not only seen diversity rise , but also retention and graduation rates . But with costs as much a barrier to entry as the admissions tests , leaders decided that tying aid to the exams could hamper their goal to broaden access to science and technology degrees .\nFirst , they stopped participating in the National Merit Scholarship Program , which requires the PSAT in junior year . But WPI \u2019 s algorithm for its own merit scholarships still used SAT/ACT scores . So in the 2016-17 cycle , the school started assigning an average test score to applicants who hadn \u2019 t submitted exam results . The next year , they cut standardized test scores completely out of the merit aid calculation .\n\u201c The public narrative that testing firms often play into is this idea that test scores are a proxy for academic quality , \u201d says Andrew Palumbo , WPI \u2019 s dean of admissions and financial aid . Once a critical mass of schools goes test-optional \u2013 particularly more nationally known universities \u2013 he believes that notion will fade . \u201c The biggest problem we have now is the legacy of standardized test scores \u2013 the myth that they are the great equalizer upon which you can put everyone side by side , \u201d he says .\nYet some schools have gone in the opposite direction . In 2013 , the University of Oregon added test scores to its merit scholarship requirements , while still considering high school GPA . The method was more transparent and the school boosted its academic profile , reports \u201c Measuring Success . \u201d\nHezekiah Owuor , for one , is happy with the approach WPI took . The student at the technical institute built a computer and taught himself to play piano , guitar , ukulele , and drums back in his hometown of Mombasa , Kenya . Now he \u2019 s the beneficiary not only of test-optional admissions , but of test-neutral merit aid as well .\n\u201c I never had the resources and facilities to be able to just simply explore , \u201d he says of his interest in combining music and computer science . Halfway through his second year at WPI , he \u2019 s planning an independent study \u201c to write code that reacts to sound and music . \u201d\nMr. Owuor sat for the SAT and the ACT in Kenya , putting in several hours of studying online each week for about a month . On top of exams for his International Baccalaureate degree , he didn \u2019 t have enough prep time to score as high as he had hoped , he says . When his counselor told him about WPI , he decided to apply without submitting his scores . He believes the school \u2019 s test-optional philosophy has not only been beneficial to him but has also had a positive effect on campus culture .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t feel like you are defined by the number that you got , \u201d he says . \u201c It \u2019 s very much an environment of innovation and what you can bring to the table \u2013 what you can do , as opposed to what this test said that you could do . \u201d",

It marks one of the biggest changes in college admissions in the past two decades.\n\nAfter classes and 4-H Club meetings and homework, Esmeralda Hernandez spent a portion of her spring semester junior year engaged in a nightly routine familiar to millions of American teens: logging on to a website to practice math, reading, and timed test-taking for the SAT.\n\nWhile she scored fairly well, she decided to study more over the summer and take the entrance exam a second time. Her hard work paid off: She earned the highest score in her small senior class in tiny Swainsboro, Georgia. But for a farmworker\u2019s daughter whose college aspirations stretched beyond state lines, it still didn\u2019t seem good enough.\n\nIn her home nestled in the woods on a dirt road, she kept looking longingly at a postcard sent by the University of Chicago, her top choice. What always caught her eye was the image of a coffee stain on the card, which, when looked at closely, showed the chemical formula for coffee. The quirky intellectualism behind the card only reinforced her desire to attend the elite university.\n\nYet she nearly gave up on her dream school, until she discovered it offered full scholarships \u2013 and the option of applying without submitting an SAT score. Suddenly, hope rushed back in, tinged with uncertainty.\n\n\u201cI thought that if I hid my test scores from the school, they would ask, what are you hiding?\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was also very freeing in the fact that I didn\u2019t have to be defined by something that was only four hours and didn\u2019t really, in my opinion, define who I was as a person. ... There were so many more things that reflected how intelligent or motivated I was.\u201d\n\nFew things in life loom over American high school students more than college admissions tests. After years of toiling to earn good grades, years of slogging through Advanced Placement courses, and years of participating in extracurricular activities to burnish their credentials, many students take a test that they\u2019ve been told can either catapult or crush their college hopes.\n\nBut now a movement is accelerating across the country \u2013 with more colleges giving students the choice of either submitting their SAT or ACT scores or not. Public and private colleges from Arizona to Illinois to Massachusetts \u2013 including some of the most elite \u2013 have adopted a test-optional model or are moving toward it. It marks one of the biggest changes in college admissions in the past two decades.\n\nThe result is a feeling of relief \u2013 and liberation \u2013 among both high schoolers and parents, in competitive metropolises and quiet rural towns alike. Perhaps more important, the move is contributing to a profound shift in the way schools and society measure a person\u2019s value. Instead of giving the impression that admissions is based largely on a single test score, more colleges now proclaim loudly that the totality of an individual \u2013 yes, the good grades earned, but also the person\u2019s unique talents and character \u2013 is so important that a test score is no longer necessary.\n\nRise of the \u201cnonsubmitters\u201d\n\nTest-optional institutions continue to accept scores from students who want to share them, as one marker of achievement, and an average of 75% of their applicants still do. But the schools are breaking down some long-held notions about how to take stock of a student\u2019s merit and likelihood of success \u2013 largely in the name of equity.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know about higher education is that it reproduces inequality ... and it\u2019s good to try and destabilize that a little,\u201d says Elisabeth Clemens, a sociology professor at UChicago who was not involved in creating the new test-optional policy.\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201cWhat we do know about higher education is that it reproduces inequality ... and it\u2019s good to try and destabilize that a little.\u201d \u2013 Elisabeth Clemens, a University of Chicago sociology professor\n\nThis neo-Gothic campus, the Midwest\u2019s closest equivalent to an Ivy League school, caused a buzz in the summer of 2018 as the first top-ranked university to go test-optional.\n\nThe list of bachelor\u2019s degree-granting institutions that de-emphasize the tests has grown to 1,060 since Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, pioneered test-optional in 1969. Today, more than half of the \u201ctop 100\u201d liberal arts colleges are on the list, the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest) reports, and about 50 joined in the past year.\n\nThe first student class to include \u201cnonsubmitters\u201d of test scores arrived at UChicago this fall. Professor Clemens says she can\u2019t tell who they are when she asks a class of first-year students to \u201cwrestle with important arguments\u201d in centuries-old texts like Hobbes\u2019 \u201cLeviathan.\u201d She trusts that both types of applicants will thrive here, though she\u2019ll keep an eye on research in the coming years on student performance.\n\nThe massive University of California system might be the next to go test-optional. Its Board of Regents had been considering dropping the SAT/ACT requirement even before students and a school district filed a recent lawsuit, claiming that the tests have a discriminatory effect because of racial and economic disparities.\n\nCalifornia could prove a \u201ctipping point, because it is the largest recipient of SAT scores in the country [and] it is viewed as the most prestigious public university system,\u201d says Robert Schaeffer, FairTest\u2019s public education director.\n\nDamian Dovarganes/AP/File Students walk on the University of California, Los Angeles campus. A school district has sued the University of California system, trying to force it to stop requiring standardized tests for admission.\n\nYet the ubiquity of the tests suggests that their demise is far from inevitable. More than 2.2 million students in the high school class of 2019 took the SAT, and 1.8 million took the ACT. Many states require and pay for students to take one of the exams.\n\nThe nonprofit groups that own the tests push back vigorously against perceptions that they are unfair or put too much pressure on teenagers. Research has shown that when combined with high school GPA, the scores boost colleges\u2019 ability to predict GPA and the likelihood that first-year students will return for a second year. \u201cIt\u2019s a measuring tool. ... You cannot blame the measurement for inequities or inequalities in society,\u201d says Marten Roorda, CEO of ACT, based in Iowa. Test makers use rigorous methods to ensure the test questions themselves are not biased, he says.\n\nThe SAT or ACT can provide opportunities for students, like Ms. Hernandez, whose talent otherwise might never have been discovered. Many colleges send out recruitment mailings to students with good scores who live in places their admissions officers don\u2019t visit.\n\nAdvocates for the tests also say that high school GPAs are not comparable, because of highly localized school systems in the United States. Without a standardized benchmark like a test result, grade inflation could become a bigger problem, and \u201cwealthier students [could] game the system by having stronger letters of recommendation\u201d or other advantages, says Lynn Letukas, who formerly worked for the College Board (which owns the SAT) and co-edited the 2018 book \u201cMeasuring Success: Testing, Grades, and the Future of College Admissions.\u201d\n\nHard work\u2019s reward\n\nThis storied Harry Potter-esque UChicago campus fringed with modern architecture is a whole new world for Ms. Hernandez. Ninety-two Nobel laureates have walked the same stone stairways and underground tunnels she scurries through between classrooms and libraries.\n\nJust as exciting to someone who used to have to drive for miles to get to Walmart, she can hop on her used olive-green bicycle and zip to class or a variety of stores in the Hyde Park community in a few minutes.\n\nBut the bike isn\u2019t the only thing accelerating her. Attending UChicago is pushing her quickly up the social mobility ladder.\n\nAt one point, she thought all she could afford was to enroll in a state public university, where she could apply two years\u2019 worth of credit she earned at community college during her high school years.\n\nHer Mexican-immigrant parents didn\u2019t attend college. And her only recent role model who left Swainsboro for an elite university was a family friend from church who went to Yale. But she felt encouraged by her small town \u2013 even the woman on the other side of the window where she went to pay her phone bill last summer asked about her plans.\n\nEyeing a major in political science and/or sociology, she says she\u2019s grateful \u201cto meet a lot more interesting people who all worked hard throughout their four years to get to someplace like this.\u201d\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201cI thought that if I hid my test scores from the school, they would ask, what are you hiding? But it was also very freeing in the fact that I didn\u2019t have to be defined by something that was only four hours and didn\u2019t really, in my opinion, define who I was as a person.\u201d \u2013 Esmeralda Hernandez, a student at the University of Chicago who didn\u2019t submit her SAT scores in her admissions application\n\nShe\u2019s sitting at a dark wooden table in Hutchinson Commons, an Oxford-inspired dining hall and student lounge, where the global mix of students contrasts with stately rows of UChicago presidential portraits lining the walls. But even indoors, the Peach State native is still wearing her beige knit cap to ward off the cold.\n\nHere she anticipates gaining insights from stellar professors, internships, and possibly a study-abroad trip to Paris or Barcelona. At a four-year school, she says, she can \u201cbe a young adult for a while, rather than just getting two years of university experience and then jumping out into a career field.\u201d\n\nUChicago requires applicants to write two essays, one about why they want to attend the school, and one based on their choice of five topics. \u201cCan you read and write and think? That\u2019s going to be a big indicator of how you do here,\u201d says admissions officer Marjorie Betley.\n\nTest-optional swayed Ms. Hernandez to apply, but her ability to come also depended on a broader set of policies \u2013 including financial aid \u2013 to open up access for underrepresented students. In the first round of test-optional admissions, in the fall of 2019, UChicago\u2019s applications jumped 20% overall. But they went up 60% for rural students and 24% for first-generation students.\n\nIn rural communities, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of test prep around there ... and a lot of students are driving two, three, four hours\u201d to get to an SAT or ACT test, says Ms. Betley, director of the university\u2019s Emerging Rural Leaders Program. \u201cTesting has never been the most important part of our application process. ... What better way to stress that than to just take [the requirement] away.\u201d\n\nMs. Hernandez\u2019s former school, Swainsboro High School, recently hosted a test-taking session for the ACT. Among the school\u2019s 160 seniors, just over half typically go on to college \u2013 usually within Georgia, says counselor Monica Pace.\n\nThose applying for public universities or scholarships have to reach a minimum SAT/ACT score, and that can motivate students to work harder on math and reading, she says. One student aimed for a scholarship that requires a 1200 on the SAT. \u201cThis recent test, she was so excited,\u201d says Ms. Pace.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s taken it three times; she finally got her score.\u201d\n\nBurden or achievement?\n\nFor parents like Pat Lynch, any move away from the pervasive presence of the SAT or ACT in high schoolers\u2019 lives is welcome. Just before noon on a crisp October Saturday, Ms. Lynch is browsing a catalog in the driver\u2019s seat of her black Volvo, waiting for her daughter to emerge from the SAT at Nashua High School North in New Hampshire. Her daughter has already taken the SAT twice at her own Roman Catholic school, and the ACT once.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s having a hard time getting a decent score, and she\u2019s a smart kid \u2013 all A\u2019s, great GPA, four years of math, four years of science \u2013 but these tests are a lot of pressure,\u201d Ms. Lynch says.\n\nShe thinks her daughter will apply without scores to the three out of five colleges on her list that are test-optional. Colleges are \u201cfinding out that this SAT is a racket,\u201d she says.\n\nNot true, say the test makers. Since a new version rolled out in 2016, the SAT has dropped \u201call vestiges of the aptitude approach used to develop the early SAT 100 years ago,\u201d College Board spokesman Zachary Goldberg writes in an email. \u201cGone are the infamous \u2018SAT words,\u2019 penalties for guessing, and math that isn\u2019t necessary for college work.\u201d\n\nMs. Hernandez acknowledges that her hours spent prepping on Khan Academy, an education platform that partners with the College Board to help applicants get ready to take the exam with a free online program, did some good. \u201cI learned certain techniques in algebra ... [and] I got a lot of critical reading training. ... I can read extremely fast and still take a lot of things in.\u201d\n\nBut the tests still feel like an unnecessary requirement to many students.\n\n\u201cBeing good at standardized testing is being good at standardized testing,\u201d says a UChicago first-year student from California who asked to keep her name private.\n\nFreshman Daniel Gendy says he felt a lot of pressure to compare his test scores with those of other potential applicants on college online forums. The night before he sent in his UChicago application, he decided to check the test-optional box. \u201cI was involved with my high school\u2019s founding of a robotics team, and I wanted that or other extracurriculars, such as fencing, to represent me,\u201d he says.\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff \u201cI was involved with my high school\u2019s founding of a robotics team, and I wanted that or other extracurriculars, such as fencing, to represent me.\u201d \u2013 Daniel Gendy, a freshman at the University of Chicago\n\nSome students think too much focus on testing can be a detriment to the academic culture.\n\n\u201cSchools are supposed to be about learning and education and just expanding your mind as much as possible,\u201d says fourth-year UChicago economics and philosophy major Max Marcussen, who hails from a rich Connecticut town where testing and tutoring go hand in hand. With test-optional admissions, the hope is that \u201chaving less emphasis on test scores means that you can focus more here on what actually matters.\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks into her first quarter, Ms. Hernandez dropped her calculus class. She had tested into it, and plans to take it later, but she found that having the optional fourth class in her schedule left no time for extracurriculars. Now she\u2019s enjoying the Model United Nations club and tutoring adults for the citizenship test.\n\nStudents here say the curriculum challenges everyone, and they get tremendous support from professors and peer tutors. But researchers have been curious about whether the academic outcomes at test-optional schools are different for those who don\u2019t submit exam scores. A 2018 study of 28 large and small institutions found that nonsubmitters had marginally lower first-year and cumulative college GPAs than submitters. But nonsubmitters graduated at equivalent or slightly higher rates. The report, co-authored by a test-optional supporter, showed that first-generation, low-income, female, and underrepresented minority students were more strongly represented among those who didn\u2019t submit test scores.\n\nSupporters of testing say the growth of diversity on these campuses can\u2019t necessarily be linked to test-optional policies, because the schools often offer other incentives to students, including financial ones. To help schools with their diversity goals, the College Board recently added a feature called Landscape, which helps give a fuller portrait of who students are and where they come from by putting scores in the context of neighborhood and school demographic information.\n\nSAT and ACT scores \u201ccan be a valuable indicator for certain students,\u201d says Peter Wilson, UChicago\u2019s director of undergraduate admissions. \u201cIf the students feel like it shows their intelligence or it shows how they\u2019re doing, we would love them to send it in. I don\u2019t think we would ever get rid of it or say we\u2019re going to be test-blind.\u201d\n\nYet that\u2019s exactly what testing critics in California want at public universities.\n\nA growing revolt\n\nUse of the SAT and ACT is \u201cmorally impermissible ... and the admissions process should no longer be contaminated by this discriminatory metric,\u201d said Mark Rosenbaum, directing attorney at the nonprofit Public Counsel, in filing a lawsuit Dec. 10 against the University of California system on behalf of students and the Compton Unified School District.\n\nCalifornia data from 2019 show that 45% of white students scored 1200 or above on the SAT, compared with 9% of African American students and 12% of Hispanics. The University of California\u2019s Academic Senate had already begun considering removal of the test requirement and is expected to make recommendations within a few months.\n\nThe growing revolt over testing could bolster a backlash against another pillar of the higher education establishment \u2013 testing-based merit aid. Some colleges, such as Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Massachusetts, have already stopped considering test scores when handing out discretionary scholarships.\n\nBreaking down the connection between \u201cso-called merit scholarships\u201d and SAT/ACT scores is \u201cthe next frontier to broaden accessibility to higher education,\u201d says FairTest\u2019s Mr. Schaeffer.\n\nAdmissions shifted to test-optional at WPI in 2007. Since then, the school has not only seen diversity rise, but also retention and graduation rates. But with costs as much a barrier to entry as the admissions tests, leaders decided that tying aid to the exams could hamper their goal to broaden access to science and technology degrees.\n\nFirst, they stopped participating in the National Merit Scholarship Program, which requires the PSAT in junior year. But WPI\u2019s algorithm for its own merit scholarships still used SAT/ACT scores. So in the 2016-17 cycle, the school started assigning an average test score to applicants who hadn\u2019t submitted exam results. The next year, they cut standardized test scores completely out of the merit aid calculation.\n\n\u201cThe public narrative that testing firms often play into is this idea that test scores are a proxy for academic quality,\u201d says Andrew Palumbo, WPI\u2019s dean of admissions and financial aid. Once a critical mass of schools goes test-optional \u2013 particularly more nationally known universities \u2013 he believes that notion will fade. \u201cThe biggest problem we have now is the legacy of standardized test scores \u2013 the myth that they are the great equalizer upon which you can put everyone side by side,\u201d he says.\n\nYet some schools have gone in the opposite direction. In 2013, the University of Oregon added test scores to its merit scholarship requirements, while still considering high school GPA. The method was more transparent and the school boosted its academic profile, reports \u201cMeasuring Success.\u201d\n\nHezekiah Owuor, for one, is happy with the approach WPI took. The student at the technical institute built a computer and taught himself to play piano, guitar, ukulele, and drums back in his hometown of Mombasa, Kenya. Now he\u2019s the beneficiary not only of test-optional admissions, but of test-neutral merit aid as well.\n\n\u201cI never had the resources and facilities to be able to just simply explore,\u201d he says of his interest in combining music and computer science. Halfway through his second year at WPI, he\u2019s planning an independent study \u201cto write code that reacts to sound and music.\u201d\n\nMr. Owuor sat for the SAT and the ACT in Kenya, putting in several hours of studying online each week for about a month. On top of exams for his International Baccalaureate degree, he didn\u2019t have enough prep time to score as high as he had hoped, he says. When his counselor told him about WPI, he decided to apply without submitting his scores. He believes the school\u2019s test-optional philosophy has not only been beneficial to him but has also had a positive effect on campus culture.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you are defined by the number that you got,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much an environment of innovation and what you can bring to the table \u2013 what you can do, as opposed to what this test said that you could do.\u201d",

        "content": "Donald Trump is making the rounds on Capitol Hill Thursday , searching for unity with Republican leaders , including reluctant House Speaker Paul Ryan . But for some GOP lawmakers , backing the brash billionaire \u2013 or rather , not backing him \u2013 is more than a matter of agreeing on tax cuts or trade , immigration or national security .\n\u201c I will not support Mr. Trump , \u201d Rep. Carlos Curbelo ( R ) of Florida has told the CBS affiliate in Miami . \u201c That is not a political decision ; that is a moral decision . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s hard to know how many of his colleagues share this view . Congressman Curbelo , who caucuses with the pragmatic wing of the conference , says \u201c a lot \u201d of Republicans have such concerns , some expressing it publicly and others privately . On Tuesday , Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson , former speechwriter to President George W. Bush , articulated the moral dimension in a commentary :\n\u201c Those who support Trump , no matter how reluctantly , have crossed a moral boundary . They are standing with a leader who encourages prejudice and despises the weak . They are aiding the transformation of a party formed by Lincoln 's blazing vision of equality into a party of white resentment . Those who find this one of the normal , everyday compromises of politics have truly lost their way . \u201d\nThose are stiff words , and interviews with several Republican lawmakers in advance of Trump \u2019 s visit found that some did not agree with them . Some say Hillary Clinton is also an immoral choice , and for that reason , they \u2019 re reluctantly backing Trump . Others feel uncomfortable making a moral judgment at all , or don \u2019 t see this as a moral choice .\nBut \u201c personal and policy morality are always involved in the selection of our leaders , \u201d says the Rev .

        "content_original": "Donald Trump is making the rounds on Capitol Hill Thursday, searching for unity with Republican leaders, including reluctant House Speaker Paul Ryan. But for some GOP lawmakers, backing the brash billionaire \u2013 or rather, not backing him \u2013 is more than a matter of agreeing on tax cuts or trade, immigration or national security.\n\n\u201cI will not support Mr. Trump,\u201d Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R) of Florida has told the CBS affiliate in Miami. \u201cThat is not a political decision; that is a moral decision.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how many of his colleagues share this view. Congressman Curbelo, who caucuses with the pragmatic wing of the conference, says \u201ca lot\u201d of Republicans have such concerns, some expressing it publicly and others privately. On Tuesday, Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, former speechwriter to President George W. Bush, articulated the moral dimension in a commentary:\n\n\u201cThose who support Trump, no matter how reluctantly, have crossed a moral boundary. They are standing with a leader who encourages prejudice and despises the weak. They are aiding the transformation of a party formed by Lincoln's blazing vision of equality into a party of white resentment. Those who find this one of the normal, everyday compromises of politics have truly lost their way.\u201d\n\nThose are stiff words, and interviews with several Republican lawmakers in advance of Trump\u2019s visit found that some did not agree with them. Some say Hillary Clinton is also an immoral choice, and for that reason, they\u2019re reluctantly backing Trump. Others feel uncomfortable making a moral judgment at all, or don\u2019t see this as a moral choice.\n\nBut \u201cpersonal and policy morality are always involved in the selection of our leaders,\u201d says the Rev. James Weiss, a professor of ethics at Boston College. Personal morality affects public behavior, and public policy always has a moral dimension \u2013 whether lawmakers are dealing with abortion, criminal justice, welfare, medical care, or even trade and taxes, he adds.\n\n\u201cThe question is never whether morality plays a role, it\u2019s to what extent it does,\u201d Reverend Weiss says.\n\nVoters \u2013 and politicians \u2013 will differ on that judgment.\n\nRejection, acceptance, and redemption\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp (R) of Kansas also has moral issues with Trump. The Kansan, a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, questions Trump\u2019s positions on \u201clife, family, and marriage,\u201d and so do a lot of other Republicans, he says. As a parent, he also worries about Trump\u2019s language.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get comfortable with a candidate if I\u2019m worried about what he\u2019ll say [on TV] in front of my 9-year-old that\u2019s vulgar and crass.\u201d\n\nHe says he\u2019s still sticking with Sen.

The rise in consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy , unexpectedly accelerated to an almost four-year high of 4 percent .\nYet amid President Donald Trump \u2019 s trade war , nonresidential business investment rose at a 0.8 percent pace , the weakest since 2016 and down from 8.7 percent in the prior quarter . Companies paused spending earlier than some economists expected given the fiscal boost from Republican-backed tax cuts .\nWhile a solid labor market and gradually rising wages are buoying consumers , investors took little comfort from GDP : The S & P 500 stock index plummeted on Friday , entering a correction following reports showing the growth engines of Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. sputtered last quarter . Analysts said the Federal Reserve probably remains on track for a December interest-rate increase , its fourth of 2018 , though the GDP details suggest the economy isn \u2019 t shifting into a permanently higher gear .\n\u201c The fate of the consumer rests with the willingness and ability of businesses to keep hiring , \u201d said Julia Coronado , president of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and a former Fed researcher .\nThe slowdown in business spending \u201c came earlier and was more than we expected , given where the stimulus is , \u201d Coronado said . \u201c That suggests some of this stimulus won \u2019 t last , it \u2019 s not going to turn into higher-trend growth through the channel of investment and greater capacity and greater potential growth . \u201d\nWhat Our Economists Say The economy has reverted back to the `` same old '' model of consumer-driven activity that has dominated most of this cycle . Supply-siders will be disappointed to see business fixed investment essentially stalling out after a robust first half , further casting into doubt the notion that corporate tax reforms could incentivize capital deepening , which could lift the long-run growth potential of the economy .\n-- Carl Riccadonna , Yelena Shulyatyeva and Tim Mahedy , \u2588\u2588\u2588 Economics\nRead more for the full reaction note from \u2588\u2588\u2588 Economics .\nTrade also dragged down growth by the most in 33 years , amid ongoing tariff battles with large trade partners such as China . Together with the business-spending figures , they \u2019 re an early indication that firms might be cooling on the kinds of activities that drive expansion , employment and wages .\nA core measure that economists monitor for a better sense of underlying demand -- final sales to domestic purchasers -- increased at a 3.1 percent pace , slowing from 4 percent . It excludes the more volatile trade and inventories components of GDP .\nFed officials have recently talked about \u201c optimism and acceleration in capital spending and could it lift the supply side , \u201d but the slowing in business investment \u201c is inconsistent with a sizable improvement in spending , \u201d said Michael Gapen , chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc and a former official at the central bank .\n\u201c In the big picture , what we \u2019 re trying to ascertain is : is fiscal stimulus transitory or will it help sustain economic growth longer term ?

        "content_original": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 4:19 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email\n\nConsumers drove the U.S. economy to better-than-expected growth in the third quarter, but a steep slowdown in business spending raised concerns about whether the strength in the expansion is sustainable.\n\nThe 3.5 percent annualized gain in gross domestic product, following 4.2 percent, marked the best back-to-back quarters since 2014, according to Friday\u2019s Commerce Department report. The rise in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy, unexpectedly accelerated to an almost four-year high of 4 percent.\n\nYet amid President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, nonresidential business investment rose at a 0.8 percent pace, the weakest since 2016 and down from 8.7 percent in the prior quarter. Companies paused spending earlier than some economists expected given the fiscal boost from Republican-backed tax cuts.\n\nWhile a solid labor market and gradually rising wages are buoying consumers, investors took little comfort from GDP: The S&P 500 stock index plummeted on Friday, entering a correction following reports showing the growth engines of Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. sputtered last quarter. Analysts said the Federal Reserve probably remains on track for a December interest-rate increase, its fourth of 2018, though the GDP details suggest the economy isn\u2019t shifting into a permanently higher gear.\n\n\u201cThe fate of the consumer rests with the willingness and ability of businesses to keep hiring,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and a former Fed researcher.\n\nThe slowdown in business spending \u201ccame earlier and was more than we expected, given where the stimulus is,\u201d Coronado said. \u201cThat suggests some of this stimulus won\u2019t last, it\u2019s not going to turn into higher-trend growth through the channel of investment and greater capacity and greater potential growth.\u201d\n\nWhat Our Economists Say The economy has reverted back to the \"same old\" model of consumer-driven activity that has dominated most of this cycle. Supply-siders will be disappointed to see business fixed investment essentially stalling out after a robust first half, further casting into doubt the notion that corporate tax reforms could incentivize capital deepening, which could lift the long-run growth potential of the economy.\n\n\n\n-- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Tim Mahedy, Bloomberg Economics\n\n\n\nRead more for the full reaction note from Bloomberg Economics.\n\nTrade also dragged down growth by the most in 33 years, amid ongoing tariff battles with large trade partners such as China. Together with the business-spending figures, they\u2019re an early indication that firms might be cooling on the kinds of activities that drive expansion, employment and wages.\n\nA core measure that economists monitor for a better sense of underlying demand -- final sales to domestic purchasers -- increased at a 3.1 percent pace, slowing from 4 percent. It excludes the more volatile trade and inventories components of GDP.\n\nFed officials have recently talked about \u201coptimism and acceleration in capital spending and could it lift the supply side,\u201d but the slowing in business investment \u201cis inconsistent with a sizable improvement in spending,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc and a former official at the central bank.\n\n\u201cIn the big picture, what we\u2019re trying to ascertain is: is fiscal stimulus transitory or will it help sustain economic growth longer term? This report shows the fiscal stimulus has a transitory response.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, the International Monetary Fund earlier this month cut its global growth forecast for the first time in two years, blaming escalating trade tensions and stresses in emerging markets. World GDP would fall further should Trump follow through on all his trade threats, including global duties on cars, the IMF said.\n\nOn the other hand, the Trump administration is optimistic, particularly as the report showed inflation remains contained: Excluding food and energy, the Fed\u2019s preferred price index also rose at a 1.6 percent rate. Trump has criticized the Fed for raising interest rates without signs of significant inflation.\n\n\u201cWe really do feel like we\u2019re in that Goldilocks moment where we\u2019re getting good GDP growth but we don\u2019t have the inflation that you traditionally might have seen with this type of market,\u201d Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on Bloomberg Television.\n\nRoberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington and a former Fed economist, said the GDP report is consistent with the central bank\u2019s forecast. \u201cThe Fed outlook is basically validated by the data,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no incentive to change policy direction.\u201d\n\nSatya Pradhuman of Cirrus Research and Simona Mocuta of State Street Global Advisors, react to the GDP data.

( AP Photo/Evan Vucci )\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to speak at an event on protecting seniors with diabetes in the Rose Garden White House , Tuesday , May 26 , 2020 , in Washington . ( AP Photo/Evan Vucci )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 In the rubble of buildings and lives , modern U.S. presidents have met national trauma with words such as these : \u201c I can hear you. \u201d \u201c You have lost too much , but you have not lost everything. \u201d \u201c We have wept with you ; we \u2019 ve pulled our children tight . \u201d\nAs diverse as they were in eloquence and empathy , George W. Bush , Bill Clinton and Barack Obama each had his own way of piercing the noise of catastrophe and reaching people .\nBut now , the known U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is fast approaching 100,000 on the watch of a president whose communication skills , potent in a political brawl , are not made for this moment .\nImpeachment placed one indelible mark on Donald Trump \u2019 s time in the White House . Now there is another , a still-growing American casualty list that has exceeded deaths from the Vietnam and Korean wars combined . U.S. fatalities from the most lethal hurricanes and earthquakes pale by comparison . This is the deadliest pandemic in a century .\nActual deaths from COVID-19 are almost certainly higher than the numbers show , an undercount to be corrected in time .\nAt every turn Trump has asserted the numbers would be worse without his leadership . Yet the toll keeps climbing . It is well beyond what he told people to expect even as his public-health authorities started bracing the country in early April for at least 100,000 deaths .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 ll be substantially under that number , \u201d he said April 10. \u201c Ten days later : \u201d We \u2019 re going toward 50- or 60,000 people. \u201d Ten days after that : \u201c We \u2019 re probably heading to 60,000 , 70,000. \u201d Though critics have said the toll shot up because he was slow to respond , he contended Tuesday it could have been 25 times higher without his actions .\nThe scale and swiftness of the pandemic \u2019 s killing are unlike anything that confronted Trump \u2019 s recent predecessors . Yet the calamity offers no where-were-you moment \u2014 no flashpoint turning blue skies black , no fusillade at an elementary school . Instead the toll unfolds in stages of sickness .\nThe pandemic is playing out in a divided country under a president who thrives on rousing his supporters and getting a rise out of those who don \u2019 t like him , whether that means forgoing a mask , playing golf while millions hunker down or thrashing opponents on Twitter . He lowered flags to half staff to recognize those who have died from the virus but had them back up days before the 100,000 marker was reached .\nHis feelings on Tuesday ? He tweeted to \u201c all the political hacks out there \u201d that without his leadership the lives lost would be far worse than the \u201c 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number . \u201d\nEarly on , when only a few hundred had died , Trump was asked at a briefing what message he had for Americans who were scared . \u201c You \u2019 re a terrible reporter , that \u2019 s what I say , \u201d he responded . \u201c I think it \u2019 s a very nasty question . \u201d\nIn the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing , the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook school and other national nightmares that brought flags to half staff , presidents found more soothing words for the frightened and grieving than Trump \u2019 s boilerplate line that one death is too many .\nEmpathy was Clinton \u2019 s wheelhouse . The rhetorically fumbly Bush grabbed eloquence by the bullhorn . The cool and controlled Obama cried .\nTrump ? \u201c I \u2019 ve never seen a president with less capacity for empathy , \u201d said Andrew J. Polsky , a political science professor at Hunter College , City University of New York , who has studied such leadership traits for decades . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t even try . ... It \u2019 s way outside his emotional comfort zone . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s touchy-feely ways are forever symbolized by his assurance that \u201c I feel your pain , \u201d which did not come from a tragic moment at all but rather an epic smackdown of a heckler . Challenged by an AIDS activist in New York in 1992 who said the Democratic candidate was more about ambition than achievement , Clinton told the man \u201c I know how it hurts ... I feel your pain \u201d but \u201c quit talking to me like that . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m sick and tired of all these people who don \u2019 t know me , know nothing about my life ... making snotty-nosed remarks about how I haven \u2019 t done anything in my life , \u201d Clinton told the crowd and the activist .\nBut Clinton \u2019 s remarks as president at the memorial service for the victims of the Oklahoma City domestic terrorist attack in 1995 exemplified compassionate leadership and helped dig him out of a political hole .\n\u201c You have lost too much , but you have not lost everything , \u201d he told the bereaved families . \u201c And you have certainly not lost America , for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes . \u201d\nHenry Cisneros , his housing secretary , told the University of Virginia \u2019 s Miller Center that Clinton that day and Bush at smoldering ground zero six years later did what presidents are called to do .\n\u201c There are moments when \u2014 and I think 9/11 was that for President Bush \u2014 you realize this is not about politics and this is not about momentary victories and this is not about your own legacy , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s about the burden you \u2019 re carrying for the people . \u201d\nBush , in off-the-cuff words through a bullhorn to New York firefighters straining to hear him , bellowed : \u201c I can hear you , the rest of the world hears you , and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. \u201d That was three days after Islamic terrorism laid waste to the World Trade Center and a chunk of the Pentagon .\nThree days after that , Bush visited a mosque to make common cause with American Muslims facing hate on the streets because of the extremists from abroad . \u201c Islam is peace , \u201d he said . \u201c Women who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes . Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America . \u201d\nMasterful oratory brought Obama to national prominence , and measured calm marked his demeanor as president . Unlike his emotional vice president , Joe Biden , Obama practiced his own kind of social distancing , to the point of aloofness .\nThe murder of 20 \u201c beautiful little children \u201d and six adults at Sandy Hook brought a different Obama to the podium the day of the attack , as he swiped at his tears a half dozen times in a brief statement and spoke of hugging America \u2019 s children and his own \u201c a little tighter \u201d than before .\nHe told mourners at Newtown \u2019 s prayer vigil two days later that \u201c all across this land of ours , we have wept with you , we \u2019 ve pulled our children tight. \u201d He talked about the teacher who told terrified kids in a barricaded room , \u201c show me your smile , \u201d and about the child who told terrified teachers : \u201c I know karate .

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to speak at an event on protecting seniors with diabetes in the Rose Garden White House, Tuesday, May 26, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In the rubble of buildings and lives, modern U.S. presidents have met national trauma with words such as these: \u201cI can hear you.\u201d \u201cYou have lost too much, but you have not lost everything.\u201d \u201cWe have wept with you; we\u2019ve pulled our children tight.\u201d\n\nAs diverse as they were in eloquence and empathy, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama each had his own way of piercing the noise of catastrophe and reaching people.\n\nBut now, the known U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is fast approaching 100,000 on the watch of a president whose communication skills, potent in a political brawl, are not made for this moment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImpeachment placed one indelible mark on Donald Trump\u2019s time in the White House. Now there is another, a still-growing American casualty list that has exceeded deaths from the Vietnam and Korean wars combined. U.S. fatalities from the most lethal hurricanes and earthquakes pale by comparison. This is the deadliest pandemic in a century .\n\nActual deaths from COVID-19 are almost certainly higher than the numbers show, an undercount to be corrected in time.\n\nAt every turn Trump has asserted the numbers would be worse without his leadership. Yet the toll keeps climbing. It is well beyond what he told people to expect even as his public-health authorities started bracing the country in early April for at least 100,000 deaths.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be substantially under that number,\u201d he said April 10.\u201c Ten days later: \u201dWe\u2019re going toward 50- or 60,000 people.\u201d Ten days after that: \u201cWe\u2019re probably heading to 60,000, 70,000.\u201d Though critics have said the toll shot up because he was slow to respond, he contended Tuesday it could have been 25 times higher without his actions.\n\nThe scale and swiftness of the pandemic\u2019s killing are unlike anything that confronted Trump\u2019s recent predecessors. Yet the calamity offers no where-were-you moment \u2014 no flashpoint turning blue skies black, no fusillade at an elementary school. Instead the toll unfolds in stages of sickness.\n\nThe pandemic is playing out in a divided country under a president who thrives on rousing his supporters and getting a rise out of those who don\u2019t like him, whether that means forgoing a mask, playing golf while millions hunker down or thrashing opponents on Twitter. He lowered flags to half staff to recognize those who have died from the virus but had them back up days before the 100,000 marker was reached.\n\nHis feelings on Tuesday? He tweeted to \u201call the political hacks out there\u201d that without his leadership the lives lost would be far worse than the \u201c100,000 plus that looks like will be the number.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarly on, when only a few hundred had died, Trump was asked at a briefing what message he had for Americans who were scared. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible reporter, that\u2019s what I say,\u201d he responded. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very nasty question.\u201d\n\nFull Coverage: Virus Outbreak\n\nIn the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook school and other national nightmares that brought flags to half staff, presidents found more soothing words for the frightened and grieving than Trump\u2019s boilerplate line that one death is too many.\n\nEmpathy was Clinton\u2019s wheelhouse. The rhetorically fumbly Bush grabbed eloquence by the bullhorn. The cool and controlled Obama cried.\n\nTrump? \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a president with less capacity for empathy,\u201d said Andrew J. Polsky, a political science professor at Hunter College, City University of New York, who has studied such leadership traits for decades. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even try. ... It\u2019s way outside his emotional comfort zone.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s touchy-feely ways are forever symbolized by his assurance that \u201cI feel your pain,\u201d which did not come from a tragic moment at all but rather an epic smackdown of a heckler. Challenged by an AIDS activist in New York in 1992 who said the Democratic candidate was more about ambition than achievement, Clinton told the man \u201cI know how it hurts ... I feel your pain\u201d but \u201cquit talking to me like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of all these people who don\u2019t know me, know nothing about my life ... making snotty-nosed remarks about how I haven\u2019t done anything in my life,\u201d Clinton told the crowd and the activist.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s remarks as president at the memorial service for the victims of the Oklahoma City domestic terrorist attack in 1995 exemplified compassionate leadership and helped dig him out of a political hole.\n\n\u201cYou have lost too much, but you have not lost everything,\u201d he told the bereaved families. \u201cAnd you have certainly not lost America, for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes.\u201d\n\nHenry Cisneros, his housing secretary, told the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center that Clinton that day and Bush at smoldering ground zero six years later did what presidents are called to do.\n\n\u201cThere are moments when \u2014 and I think 9/11 was that for President Bush \u2014 you realize this is not about politics and this is not about momentary victories and this is not about your own legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the burden you\u2019re carrying for the people.\u201d\n\nBush, in off-the-cuff words through a bullhorn to New York firefighters straining to hear him, bellowed: \u201cI can hear you, the rest of the world hears you, and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\u201d That was three days after Islamic terrorism laid waste to the World Trade Center and a chunk of the Pentagon.\n\nThree days after that, Bush visited a mosque to make common cause with American Muslims facing hate on the streets because of the extremists from abroad. \u201cIslam is peace,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes. Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America.\u201d\n\nMasterful oratory brought Obama to national prominence, and measured calm marked his demeanor as president. Unlike his emotional vice president, Joe Biden, Obama practiced his own kind of social distancing, to the point of aloofness.\n\nThe murder of 20 \u201cbeautiful little children\u201d and six adults at Sandy Hook brought a different Obama to the podium the day of the attack, as he swiped at his tears a half dozen times in a brief statement and spoke of hugging America\u2019s children and his own \u201ca little tighter\u201d than before.\n\nHe told mourners at Newtown\u2019s prayer vigil two days later that \u201call across this land of ours, we have wept with you, we\u2019ve pulled our children tight.\u201d He talked about the teacher who told terrified kids in a barricaded room, \u201cshow me your smile,\u201d and about the child who told terrified teachers: \u201cI know karate. So it\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll lead the way out.\u201d\n\nObama spoke admiringly during his presidency of \u201cthe incredible strength and resolve\u201d of Bush\u2019s bullhorn speech, despite their differences over the Iraq war and other matters of policy. In the midst of a catastrophe or when looking back on it, presidents cite the words of predecessors to project continuity and grace.\n\nThis, too, is not Trump\u2019s way. He attacks Obama and snorts at Bush\u2019s appeal from retirement for empathy and unity at a time of national emergency.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a human being with certain qualities,\u201d Polsky said of Trump. In this crisis, \u201cthese qualities haven\u2019t been useful because they don\u2019t unite people, they don\u2019t express concern for people\u2019s well-being.\u201d\n\nTrump came to power mirroring the grievances, anger and resentment of those who felt forgotten, Polsky said, and he remains angry, resentful and aggrieved \u2014 you could say true to himself.",

        "content": "In the wake of Republican victories in the election last fall , pundits warned that Congress would be at loggerheads with President Obama on a number of budget issues in 2015 , including over highway funding and the Department of Homeland Security .\nNot high on the list of hot topics : Social Security .\nYet the vaunted social insurance system is suddenly a hot part of the fiscal debate in Washington \u2013 and it 's not waiting for 2016 elections . The new Obama budget proposes a patch to the program \u2019 s support for people with disabilities , but Republicans say the system needs an overhaul , not a Band-Aid .\nHow urgent an issue is this ? Specifically , how real is the financial trouble for the disability program ?\nThe two sides are far apart on their characterizations , but they agree that something needs to be done , and a good case can be made that the reality is between the extremes .\nMany Democrats and liberals say , in effect , that Social Security \u2019 s Disability Insurance program is in trouble only if Republicans refuse to rubber stamp Mr. Obama \u2019 s fix .\nSen. Bernie Sanders ( I ) of Vermont , the top member of the Democratic caucus on the Senate Budget Committee , accused Republicans of trying \u201c to manufacture a crisis where none exists . \u201d\nOn the Republican side , Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming , who chairs that panel , says that \u201c by December of next year , the program will be broke . \u201d\nWhat 's new is that after years of talk about Social Security 's solvency and the need to reform it ( or not ) , Congress has come to its first definitive fork in the road on the issue . Perhaps the problem isn \u2019 t as dire as Republicans say it is , but Obama also might not have a slam-dunk case for his patch .\nA good many economists agree with the Republican view that reforms are needed to keep the system solvent \u2013 and the sooner they \u2019 re enacted , the better it will be for the nation \u2019 s fiscal health .\nThe programs .

        "content_original": "In the wake of Republican victories in the election last fall, pundits warned that Congress would be at loggerheads with President Obama on a number of budget issues in 2015, including over highway funding and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nNot high on the list of hot topics: Social Security.\n\nYet the vaunted social insurance system is suddenly a hot part of the fiscal debate in Washington \u2013 and it's not waiting for 2016 elections. The new Obama budget proposes a patch to the program\u2019s support for people with disabilities, but Republicans say the system needs an overhaul, not a Band-Aid.\n\nHow urgent an issue is this? Specifically, how real is the financial trouble for the disability program?\n\nThe two sides are far apart on their characterizations, but they agree that something needs to be done, and a good case can be made that the reality is between the extremes.\n\nMany Democrats and liberals say, in effect, that Social Security\u2019s Disability Insurance program is in trouble only if Republicans refuse to rubber stamp Mr. Obama\u2019s fix.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont, the top member of the Democratic caucus on the Senate Budget Committee, accused Republicans of trying \u201cto manufacture a crisis where none exists.\u201d\n\nOn the Republican side, Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, who chairs that panel, says that \u201cby December of next year, the program will be broke.\u201d\n\nWhat's new is that after years of talk about Social Security's solvency and the need to reform it (or not), Congress has come to its first definitive fork in the road on the issue. Perhaps the problem isn\u2019t as dire as Republicans say it is, but Obama also might not have a slam-dunk case for his patch.\n\nA good many economists agree with the Republican view that reforms are needed to keep the system solvent \u2013 and the sooner they\u2019re enacted, the better it will be for the nation\u2019s fiscal health.\n\nHere are key facts behind the rhetoric:\n\nThe programs. The Social Security system has two trust funds, one for Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (essentially retirees) and one for Disability Insurance. The two funds (OASDI) have their own official balances and allocation of revenues from Social Security payroll taxes \u2013 and hence they have differing levels of solvency.\n\nThe problem. The old-age trust fund is on track to be able to keep paying promised benefits in full through 2034, but the DI program can only do this through 2016, according to estimates from Social Security\u2019s trustees.\n\nGoing 'broke'? The 2016 date is where Senator Enzi and others draw references to DI \u201cbankruptcy\u201d or going \u201cbroke\u201d by next year. It\u2019s also what prompts the Obama administration to call for a fix. But the DI program would still have enough tax revenue that could keep funding about 81 percent of promised benefits. That\u2019s not good for beneficiaries, but it\u2019s not the same as going broke.\n\nObama's proposal. Obama\u2019s proposed fix is designed to balance things out so the two trust funds last for the same amount of time before running dry. It would put a higher share of payroll taxes toward the DI program, and a smaller share toward the old-age program. By Social Security\u2019s estimates, that would mean neither trust fund would be depleted until 2033.\n\nLooking ahead. That 2033 date is the one many Democrats emphasize when they call the other side alarmists. Yet at best, that merely postpones one day of reckoning (the 2016 DI deadline) while bringing another one (for the old-age program) a year closer.

Orrin Hatch of Utah had a valid point when he argued this week on the Senate floor that \u201chaving a joint trust fund exhaustion as a target doesn\u2019t solve any fundamental financial problem facing ...
