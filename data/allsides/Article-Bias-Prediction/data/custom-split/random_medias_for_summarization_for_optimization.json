Israel score: a big-time positive for Romney\n\nLondon Olympics. Romney stepped into a haymaker here delivered by the British press. In an interview with NBC News, he said he was worried about whether the Olympics would go smoothly. Whoops. Criticizing Britain on British soil didn't go over at all. Romney got pounded, and when the British press was finished with him, American columnists took over.\n\nRomney should have known better. But, as it turned out, troubles have hit the Olympics: sparse crowds, ticket scalping by Olympics officials, and mix-ups that kept family members from seeing their kin in action. Romney was partially vindicated, though he got no credit. London Olympics score: negative.\n\nWith a good speech today, Romney will complete his trip with a positive score, for what it's worth. The outcome of the election has little to do with his trip abroad, and much to do with the economy.",

        "content": "The idea of a team of rivals serving the president best by offering an array of passionately held and clashing views for the chief executive to ponder has been around since at least Abraham Lincoln .\nAnd for the last 17 months of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency , the White House has depicted the president as relishing the strong and often conflicting positions within his national security team \u2013 and above all between Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and the famously self-assertive and acerbic national security adviser , John Bolton .\nThat portrayal took a hit Tuesday when Mr. Trump abruptly announced through a tweet that he was firing Mr. Bolton , with whom he said he had often \u201c strongly disagreed. \u201d Mr. Bolton said he had resigned .\nThe president went on to hint at the widely known reality that Mr. Bolton had increasingly found himself the White House odd man out \u2013 both in personality and in viewpoint on issues from Iran to North Korea and Afghanistan .\n\u201c I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions , \u201d Mr. Trump tweeted , \u201c as did others in the Administration . \u201d\nWhether it was by firing or resignation , Mr. Bolton \u2019 s departure had seemed inevitable for a while .\nYet what spelled the doom of Mr. Trump \u2019 s third national security adviser in less than three years was not so much his strong views on key foreign-policy issues , former officials and national security analysts say . Rather , it was his take-charge approach to issues , among them Iran and Venezuela , that annoyed a president who may appreciate hearing different viewpoints but does not like being pushed in directions his gut tells him he doesn \u2019 t want to go .\nMoreover , the president does not tolerate any suggestion , particularly to the press or the public generally , that anyone but him is in charge .\n\u201c Trump likes a multiplicity of advisers presenting a variety of approaches , but he is very averse to situations where his advisers are ganging up on him and leading him to a certain line of thinking \u2013 that he does not like , \u201d says Peter Feaver , a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University in Durham , North Carolina . \u201c It \u2019 s one thing if the president hasn \u2019 t decided what to do , but it \u2019 s quite another if the president has decided to go left , and his adviser is there saying , \u2018 No no no , you \u2019 ve got to go right . \u2019 \u201d\nIndeed Professor Feaver , who directed national security strategy planning during President George W.
