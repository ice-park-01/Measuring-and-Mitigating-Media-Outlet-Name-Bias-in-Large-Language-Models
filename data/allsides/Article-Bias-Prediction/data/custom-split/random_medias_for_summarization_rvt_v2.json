        "authors": "Dan Roberts, Sabrina Siddiqui",
        "content": "Departing president passes the baton to Hillary Clinton in emotional Democratic convention speech that cast Donald Trump as a threat to American values\nBarack Obama led an emotional assault on Donald Trump \u2019 s patriotism in his last big speech to adoring Democrats on Wednesday , casting the Republican as a threat not just to his legacy , but to American democracy .\n\u201c Show the world we still believe in the promise of a great nation , \u201d the president urged both delegates and a national audience which is in real danger of voting for someone he dubbed a \u201c home-grown demagogue \u201d .\nThe departing president was joined on stage by Hillary Clinton , making her first surprise appearance of the convention before an electrified crowd , which seems more than ready to embrace her . The biggest cheer of the week in Philadelphia came as Obama and Clinton walked off , arms wrapped around each other .\nAn evening which began with the raw emotion of people touched by gun violence from Sandy Hook to Orlando became an overt mission by a succession of big Democratic names to reach those independent voters outside of the room tempted by Trump \u2019 s appeal to struggling middle-class families in an anti-establishment mood .\nEarlier , vice-president Joe Biden stole the show with a blunt retort aimed at Trump . \u201c This guy doesn \u2019 t have a clue about the middle class , \u201d blasted a politician who revels in his blue-collar roots . \u201c Not a clue , \u201d chanted back the audience .\nBut it was a trickier balancing act for the cerebral president , seeking simultaneously to take a victory lap and pass the baton safely to the right team .\n\u201c America is already great , \u201d insisted Obama as he inverted Trump \u2019 s central theme to suggest it is his populism which threatens the country \u2019 s values most : \u201c The American dream is something no wall will ever contain . \u201d\nAmerica has changed , Obama said , but its values have not , adding : \u201c We don \u2019 t fear the future ; we shape it . We embrace it , as one people , stronger together than we are on our own . That \u2019 s what Hillary Clinton understands \u2013 this fighter , this stateswoman , this mother and grandmother , this public servant , this patriot \u2013 that \u2019 s the America she \u2019 s fighting for . \u201d\nOn a day dominated by allegations of Russian interference in the election and an apparent call by Trump inciting Russia to help reveal Clinton \u2019 s emails , Obama presented the Republican nominee as fundamentally anti-American .\n\u201c We do not look to be ruled , \u201d he said , rejecting the strongman philosophy , adding : \u201c He is offering slogans and fear . He is betting that if he scares enough people , he might win just enough votes to win this election , and that \u2019 s another bet that Donald Trump will lose . \u201d\nPrivately however , Clinton campaign chair John Podesta has been warning against complacency , telling staff that Trump is \u201c not a serious man , but a man to be taken seriously \u201d .\nObama walked off stage to a triumphant Stevie Wonder hit Signed , Sealed , Delivered I \u2019 m Yours , which could be read as a love song to those in the room , but may strike a more dissonant note among those that they still need to win over .\n\u201c Yes , we have still got more work to do , \u201d acknowledged Obama , conceding that change is never quick and that he had always insisted \u201c we wouldn \u2019 t meet all of our challenges in one term , or one presidency , or even in one lifetime \u201d .\nNevertheless , a warm-up video celebrated a host of achievements worshipped in the convention hall , yet contentious outside : Obamacare , gun control , climate change and marriage equality .\n\u201c I stand before you tonight after two terms as your president to tell you that I am more optimistic about the future of your country than ever before . How could I not be ? \u201d asked the president .\nObama began by recalling his introduction to national life at the Democratic convention 12 years ago . Yet after two weeks of intrigue over who will be the next president , he already felt like a historic figure : half campaigning for his successor , and half burnishing his legacy .\nAt times , the great orator of the age felt oddly flat too : upstaged by the energy of Biden and , above all , by the uplifting address of Michelle Obama two nights earlier .

        "content_original": "Departing president passes the baton to Hillary Clinton in emotional Democratic convention speech that cast Donald Trump as a threat to American values\n\nBarack Obama led an emotional assault on Donald Trump\u2019s patriotism in his last big speech to adoring Democrats on Wednesday, casting the Republican as a threat not just to his legacy, but to American democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cShow the world we still believe in the promise of a great nation,\u201d the president urged both delegates and a national audience which is in real danger of voting for someone he dubbed a \u201chome-grown demagogue\u201d.\n\nThe departing president was joined on stage by Hillary Clinton, making her first surprise appearance of the convention before an electrified crowd, which seems more than ready to embrace her. The biggest cheer of the week in Philadelphia came as Obama and Clinton walked off, arms wrapped around each other.\n\nAn evening which began with the raw emotion of people touched by gun violence from Sandy Hook to Orlando became an overt mission by a succession of big Democratic names to reach those independent voters outside of the room tempted by Trump\u2019s appeal to struggling middle-class families in an anti-establishment mood.\n\nEarlier, vice-president Joe Biden stole the show with a blunt retort aimed at Trump. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t have a clue about the middle class,\u201d blasted a politician who revels in his blue-collar roots. \u201cNot a clue,\u201d chanted back the audience.\n\nBut it was a trickier balancing act for the cerebral president, seeking simultaneously to take a victory lap and pass the baton safely to the right team.\n\n\u201cAmerica is already great,\u201d insisted Obama as he inverted Trump\u2019s central theme to suggest it is his populism which threatens the country\u2019s values most: \u201cThe American dream is something no wall will ever contain.\u201d\n\nAmerica has changed, Obama said, but its values have not, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t fear the future; we shape it. We embrace it, as one people, stronger together than we are on our own. That\u2019s what Hillary Clinton understands \u2013 this fighter, this stateswoman, this mother and grandmother, this public servant, this patriot \u2013 that\u2019s the America she\u2019s fighting for.\u201d\n\nOn a day dominated by allegations of Russian interference in the election and an apparent call by Trump inciting Russia to help reveal Clinton\u2019s emails, Obama presented the Republican nominee as fundamentally anti-American.\n\n\u201cWe do not look to be ruled,\u201d he said, rejecting the strongman philosophy, adding: \u201cHe is offering slogans and fear. He is betting that if he scares enough people, he might win just enough votes to win this election, and that\u2019s another bet that Donald Trump will lose.\u201d\n\nPrivately however, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta has been warning against complacency, telling staff that Trump is \u201cnot a serious man, but a man to be taken seriously\u201d.\n\nObama walked off stage to a triumphant Stevie Wonder hit Signed, Sealed, Delivered I\u2019m Yours, which could be read as a love song to those in the room, but may strike a more dissonant note among those that they still need to win over.\n\n\u201cYes, we have still got more work to do,\u201d acknowledged Obama, conceding that change is never quick and that he had always insisted \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t meet all of our challenges in one term, or one presidency, or even in one lifetime\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, a warm-up video celebrated a host of achievements worshipped in the convention hall, yet contentious outside: Obamacare, gun control, climate change and marriage equality.\n\n\u201cI stand before you tonight after two terms as your president to tell you that I am more optimistic about the future of your country than ever before. How could I not be?\u201d asked the president.\n\nObama began by recalling his introduction to national life at the Democratic convention 12 years ago. Yet after two weeks of intrigue over who will be the next president, he already felt like a historic figure: half campaigning for his successor, and half burnishing his legacy.\n\nAt times, the great orator of the age felt oddly flat too: upstaged by the energy of Biden and, above all, by the uplifting address of Michelle Obama two nights earlier. Aides backstage revealed that the president had been through six drafts of the speech in the last week, staying up until 3am to rewrite it after watching the first lady\u2019s.\n\n\n\nThere were sporadic, isolated protests from the floor too \u2013 something Obama has had to deal with all his presidency, but more manageable in a vast and overwhelmingly sympathetic hall.\n\nThe room came alive, however when he turned to appraise \u201cthe next president of the United States\u201d, Hillary Clinton. \u201cYou may remember we were rivals \u2026 she was tough, she was doing everything I was doing but just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards and in heels.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much people try to knock her down, she never ever quits,\u201d he added to roars, \u201cThere has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill, more qualified than Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Obama started before a predictable response to his first reference of the opponent. \u201cDon\u2019t boo, vote!\u201d he shot back, recycling a quip likely to get good service over the next 100 days.\n\nBiden also rolled out lines that Democrats are likely to rely on heavily in future weeks, angrily reclaiming the flag from a Republican party that claims increasing monopoly on patriotism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a good bet to bet against America,\u201d said the vice-president to chants of \u201cUSA, USA\u201d. \u201cWe not only have the biggest economy in the world we have the strongest economy in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not scare easily,\u201d added a fired-up Biden. \u201cWe overcome and we always always move forward. The 21st century is going to be the American century \u2026 we own the finish line. Don\u2019t forget it!\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential pick Tim Kaine struck a more conciliatory tone, making the first serious attempt of the week to reach out to the many Republicans known to be contemptuous of Trump.\n\n\u201cIf any of you [Republicans] are looking for the party of Lincoln, we got a home for you here,\u201d said Kaine, in a line that sums up why this Virginia moderate was picked as Clinton\u2019s running mate.\n\nA series of Republicans also appeared on video saying Trump is a \u201cnot fit to be commander-in-chief\u201d, including the remarkable sight of the party\u2019s last nominee, Mitt Romney, being used to help boost a Democratic convention.\n\nRetired rear admiral John Hutson, a former Republican, took to the stage. \u201cThis morning he invited Russia to hack us,\u201d he began to supportive boos from the crowd \u201cThat\u2019s not law and order; that\u2019s criminal intent.\n\n\u201cMore than 20 Republican national security leaders recently warned that Donald Trump would make American \u2018less safe\u2019. He even mocks John McCain,\u201d he added, before recalling a famous putdown of Dan Quayle: \u201cDonald, you\u2019re not fit to polish John McCain\u2019s boots.\u201d\n\nFormer New York mayor and businessman Michael Bloomberg also attempted to reach out to floating voters.\n\n\u201cI have been a Republican and a Democrat and eventually an independent,\u201d he said. \u201cNot many people in this room can say that, but lots of people watching at home can and now they are weighing their choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one,\u201d he added in a strong attack on Trump. \u201cHillary Clinton understands that this is not reality television; this is reality.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta said: \u201cMeanwhile Donald Trump says he gets his foreign policy experience from watching TV and running the Miss Universe contest. If only it was funny, but it is deadly serious.\u201d\n\nBut even this moment of apparent unity was interrupted by more chanting. \u201cNo more war!\u201d erupted a section of Bernie Sanders supporters sitting in the Washington and Oregon delegations. It prompted arena authorities to shut down lights in their section, the protesters to wave camera torches in the gloom.\n\nKaine also ran into trouble on the left. A small group of Sanders protesters began to interrupt him but were quickly surrounded by Clinton supporters who were encouraged to stand up in front of them by battle-scarred floor whips. Others struck up a chant of \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d toward a moderate many progressives regard with distrust, but Kaine\u2019s modest, self-deprecating demeanor defused a return to the outright revolt of Monday.\n\n\n\nObama delivered praise to the Sanders fan club: \u201cIf you agree that there is too much inequality and too much money in politics we all need to be as vocal and as persistent as Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Feel the Bern!\u201d\n\nBut he also issued a direct challenge to the Bernie or Bust contingent: \u201cYou can\u2019t stay home just because she doesn\u2019t align with you on every issue.\u201d\n\nObama himself remained popular among both camps, prompting tears from many who sense the twilight of a groundbreaking administration.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama stands with Hillary Clinton after her surprise appearance onstage. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP\n\nJayne Mazzotti, a delegate from Obama\u2019s home state of Illinois, said she had been in the room for all of his convention speeches: from when he burst onto the national stage in Boston in 2004, to when he became the first African American to accept the nomination of a major party in in Denver in 2008, to fighting for his re-election in Charlotte in 2012 and now his final stand in Philadelphia in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe has evolved and grown with precious few missteps,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a true favorite of mine as a president, and I\u2019ve been through a few.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference between a Barack Obama and a Donald Trump, should he for whatever reason win this election, will just be a world apart.

        "content": "Richard Spencer \u2019 s first major event since the Virginia violence comes as public universities find themselves in a bind over providing a platform for the far right\nStudents at the University of Florida , where a white nationalist leader will speak on Thursday , are facing a difficult choice .\nThey could listen to Richard Spencer , who wants to form a \u201c white ethno-state \u201d in North America , address the aftermath of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left dozens of counter-protesters seriously injured and one young woman dead . They could protest as part of the \u201c No Nazis at University of Florida \u201d rally , which more than 2,000 people on Facebook say they plan to attend . Or they could go to Disney World .\nValery Raymond , 22 , said he believed going to Disney World with his college friends would be the best choice .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 view of the white nationalists : tomorrow must not belong to them | Editorial Read more\n\u201c Protesting in this situation wouldn \u2019 t elicit anything positive , \u201d said Raymond , who is black . \u201c I just feel the best thing to do was just to get away , get far enough where I wouldn \u2019 t even think about it . \u201d\nSpencer , he said , is \u201c basically like a class clown , and they just want attention . If you don \u2019 t give them attention , then they lose power . \u201d\nThursday \u2019 s afternoon speech in Gainesville , Florida , will be Spencer \u2019 s first major public event since a joint rally of far-right groups Charlottesville sparked open fighting in the streets and a fatal attack on a crowd of counter-protesters .\nFlorida \u2019 s governor , Rick Scott , has already declared a state of emergency in the county where the school is located , giving local law enforcement more resources and latitude to respond to unfolding events . On Twitter , Spencer has shared multiple posts comparing himself to a hurricane about to hit Florida .\nSince Charlottesville , American public universities have split over whether to allow him to speak or deny him a platform and face a lawsuit over free speech rights .\nIn April , Auburn University in Alabama attempted to shut down Spencer \u2019 s visit to its campus over concerns that it would endanger public safety . But a federal judge handed him a victory , ordering Auburn to let Spencer speak , citing first amendment protections .\nPlay Video 2:27 President condemns violence 'on many sides ' \u2013 video\n\u201c While Mr Spencer \u2019 s beliefs and message are controversial , Auburn presented no evidence that Mr Spencer advocates violence , \u201d US district judge Keith Watkins ruled . He also wrote that to cancel Spencer \u2019 s speech \u201c based on its belief that listeners and protest groups opposed to Mr Spencer \u2019 s ideology would react to the content of his speech by engaging in protests that could cause violence or property damage \u201d was not a legal justification .\nFor Spencer , the University of Florida speech may be a chance to try to reset the conversation from the intense public condemnation that followed Charlottesville . A speech at Texas A & M University last year offered him the opportunity to garner new media attention after the outrage over Spencer \u2019 s choice to shout \u201c Hail Trump ! Hail Victory ! \u201d at a conference last November , which was met with Nazi salutes .\nBut his visit is also part of an ongoing white nationalist strategy to force public universities to serve as platforms for extreme racist ideas under the banner of freedom of speech .\nSome first amendment experts say public universities are in a bind . Floyd Abrams , a prominent attorney and advocate who specializes in free speech , wrote in an email : \u201c If non-students are permitted to rent space \u2026 the university generally may not make distinctions about to whom they rent it based on the content of what they will say. \u201d But , he noted , if Spencer had incited violence in the past , that could be used to deny him access to public university spaces .\nThe majority of students , who don \u2019 t want anything to do with this event , they just want to be as far away as possible Dwayne Fletcher , University of Florida 's black student union president\nPlus , advocates of free speech on campus have a powerful supporter in Donald Trump \u2019 s attorney general , Jeff Sessions , who held a press conference in September promising that the justice department would pursue legal action against universities who infringed on speech freedoms .\n\u201c Freedom of thought and speech on the American campus are under attack , \u201d he said . \u201c A mature society can tell the difference between violence and unpopular speech . \u201d\nThe University of Cincinnati , a public university , said this month that it would allow Spencer to speak on campus . But both Michigan State University \u2013 which was sued by one of Spencer \u2019 s supporters \u2013 and Ohio State University said they would not host him , citing safety concerns . Ohio State said , though , that it was \u201c currently considering other alternatives \u201d . Other universities , including Penn State , Louisiana State University , Texas A & M and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill , issued statements in August saying that Spencer was not welcome .\nWhile the University of Florida initially blocked Spencer from speaking in September , it later reversed course , giving him a new date to speak in October . W Kent Fuchs , the University of Florida \u2019 s president , has said the school is obligated by law both to allow Spencer to speak , as well as to shoulder the more than $ 500,000 it will cost to provide security while Spencer exercises his freedom of speech .\n\u201c If you are like me , I expect you are surprised and even shocked to learn that UF is required by law to allow Mr Spencer to speak his racist views on our campus , \u201d Fuchs said in a statement in early October , urging students to avoid Spencer \u2019 s speech but \u201c speak up for your values \u201d .\nSome faculty critics accused the university president of enabling Spencer \u2019 s activism .\n\u201c The president has already announced , in effect , \u2018 Nazi of the Year \u2019 day , where we can spend half a million dollars every year so we can hear a Nazi , \u201d Thomas Auxter , a university philosophy professor , said at a campus teach-in on Tuesday night that attracted more than 100 people .\nDwayne Fletcher , the president of the university \u2019 s black student union , said that reaction to Spencer \u2019 s visit among students of color was divided . \u201c The majority of students , who don \u2019 t want anything to do with this event , they just want to be as far away as possible , \u201d he said . A smaller number were determined to protest .\nBad things don \u2019 t vanish when you look away . Do n't ignore Milo Yiannopoulos | Jeff Sparrow Read more\nTo keep students safe , student groups were organizing a virtual counter-protest to Spencer \u2019 s speech , rather than an in-person event that might be targeted by his white nationalist supporters .\nIn hopes of seeing Spencer lecture to an almost-empty hall , a local brewery in downtown Gainesville announced it would give patrons a free beer in exchange for each unused pair of tickets to the white nationalist \u2019 s speech .\n\u201c We unfortunately can \u2019 t stop him from bringing his hate to Gainesville , but we can empty the room so his disgusting message goes unheard , \u201d Alligator Brewing wrote in an Instagram post last week .\nIn response , Padgett , Spencer \u2019 s college tour organizer , announced in a Twitter video on Monday that the university \u2019 s Phillips Center would no longer be distributing tickets to the event .

        "content_original": "Richard Spencer\u2019s first major event since the Virginia violence comes as public universities find themselves in a bind over providing a platform for the far right\n\nStudents at the University of Florida, where a white nationalist leader will speak on Thursday, are facing a difficult choice.\n\nThey could listen to Richard Spencer, who wants to form a \u201cwhite ethno-state\u201d in North America, address the aftermath of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left dozens of counter-protesters seriously injured and one young woman dead. They could protest as part of the \u201cNo Nazis at University of Florida\u201d rally, which more than 2,000 people on Facebook say they plan to attend. Or they could go to Disney World.\n\nValery Raymond, 22, said he believed going to Disney World with his college friends would be the best choice.\n\nThe Guardian view of the white nationalists: tomorrow must not belong to them | Editorial Read more\n\n\u201cProtesting in this situation wouldn\u2019t elicit anything positive,\u201d said Raymond, who is black. \u201cI just feel the best thing to do was just to get away, get far enough where I wouldn\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n\nSpencer, he said, is \u201cbasically like a class clown, and they just want attention. If you don\u2019t give them attention, then they lose power.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s afternoon speech in Gainesville, Florida, will be Spencer\u2019s first major public event since a joint rally of far-right groups Charlottesville sparked open fighting in the streets and a fatal attack on a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nFlorida\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, has already declared a state of emergency in the county where the school is located, giving local law enforcement more resources and latitude to respond to unfolding events. On Twitter, Spencer has shared multiple posts comparing himself to a hurricane about to hit Florida.\n\nSince Charlottesville, American public universities have split over whether to allow him to speak or deny him a platform and face a lawsuit over free speech rights.\n\nIn April, Auburn University in Alabama attempted to shut down Spencer\u2019s visit to its campus over concerns that it would endanger public safety. But a federal judge handed him a victory, ordering Auburn to let Spencer speak, citing first amendment protections.\n\n\n\nPlay Video 2:27 President condemns violence 'on many sides' \u2013 video\n\n\u201cWhile Mr Spencer\u2019s beliefs and message are controversial, Auburn presented no evidence that Mr Spencer advocates violence,\u201d US district judge Keith Watkins ruled. He also wrote that to cancel Spencer\u2019s speech \u201cbased on its belief that listeners and protest groups opposed to Mr Spencer\u2019s ideology would react to the content of his speech by engaging in protests that could cause violence or property damage\u201d was not a legal justification.\n\nFor Spencer, the University of Florida speech may be a chance to try to reset the conversation from the intense public condemnation that followed Charlottesville. A speech at Texas A&M University last year offered him the opportunity to garner new media attention after the outrage over Spencer\u2019s choice to shout \u201cHail Trump! Hail Victory!\u201d at a conference last November, which was met with Nazi salutes.\n\nBut his visit is also part of an ongoing white nationalist strategy to force public universities to serve as platforms for extreme racist ideas under the banner of freedom of speech.\n\n\n\nSome first amendment experts say public universities are in a bind. Floyd Abrams, a prominent attorney and advocate who specializes in free speech, wrote in an email: \u201cIf non-students are permitted to rent space \u2026 the university generally may not make distinctions about to whom they rent it based on the content of what they will say.\u201d But, he noted, if Spencer had incited violence in the past, that could be used to deny him access to public university spaces.\n\nThe majority of students, who don\u2019t want anything to do with this event, they just want to be as far away as possible Dwayne Fletcher, University of Florida's black student union president\n\nPlus, advocates of free speech on campus have a powerful supporter in Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who held a press conference in September promising that the justice department would pursue legal action against universities who infringed on speech freedoms.\n\n\n\n\u201cFreedom of thought and speech on the American campus are under attack,\u201d he said. \u201cA mature society can tell the difference between violence and unpopular speech.\u201d\n\nThe University of Cincinnati, a public university, said this month that it would allow Spencer to speak on campus. But both Michigan State University \u2013 which was sued by one of Spencer\u2019s supporters \u2013 and Ohio State University said they would not host him, citing safety concerns. Ohio State said, though, that it was \u201ccurrently considering other alternatives\u201d. Other universities, including Penn State, Louisiana State University, Texas A&M and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, issued statements in August saying that Spencer was not welcome.\n\nWhile the University of Florida initially blocked Spencer from speaking in September, it later reversed course, giving him a new date to speak in October. W Kent Fuchs, the University of Florida\u2019s president, has said the school is obligated by law both to allow Spencer to speak, as well as to shoulder the more than $500,000 it will cost to provide security while Spencer exercises his freedom of speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you are like me, I expect you are surprised and even shocked to learn that UF is required by law to allow Mr Spencer to speak his racist views on our campus,\u201d Fuchs said in a statement in early October, urging students to avoid Spencer\u2019s speech but \u201cspeak up for your values\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Richard Spencer at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Washington in February. Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images\n\nSome faculty critics accused the university president of enabling Spencer\u2019s activism.\n\n\u201cThe president has already announced, in effect, \u2018Nazi of the Year\u2019 day, where we can spend half a million dollars every year so we can hear a Nazi,\u201d Thomas Auxter, a university philosophy professor, said at a campus teach-in on Tuesday night that attracted more than 100 people.\n\nDwayne Fletcher, the president of the university\u2019s black student union, said that reaction to Spencer\u2019s visit among students of color was divided. \u201cThe majority of students, who don\u2019t want anything to do with this event, they just want to be as far away as possible,\u201d he said. A smaller number were determined to protest.\n\nBad things don\u2019t vanish when you look away. Don't ignore Milo Yiannopoulos | Jeff Sparrow Read more\n\nTo keep students safe, student groups were organizing a virtual counter-protest to Spencer\u2019s speech, rather than an in-person event that might be targeted by his white nationalist supporters.\n\nIn hopes of seeing Spencer lecture to an almost-empty hall, a local brewery in downtown Gainesville announced it would give patrons a free beer in exchange for each unused pair of tickets to the white nationalist\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cWe unfortunately can\u2019t stop him from bringing his hate to Gainesville, but we can empty the room so his disgusting message goes unheard,\u201d Alligator Brewing wrote in an Instagram post last week.\n\nIn response, Padgett, Spencer\u2019s college tour organizer, announced in a Twitter video on Monday that the university\u2019s Phillips Center would no longer be distributing tickets to the event. Instead, Spencer\u2019s supporters themselves will be distributing the tickets outside the Phillips Center about an hour before the speech.\n\nOrganizers of the protest against the white nationalists have questioned why the university is allowing Spencer to control ticketing for his event, which will create a \u201cvolatile situation\u201d outside the event space and is a \u201chuge danger\u201d, student organizer Chad Chavira said.\n\nWhile the University of Florida is not canceling all classes on Thursday, instructors are dealing with classes and student concerns on an individual basis, the university has said in statements. Raymond, whose one class on Thursday has been cancelled, later decided it did not make sense for him to spend the money to go to Disney World, so he plans instead to \u201crelax by the pool, do some schoolwork\u201d, far away from campus.\n\nSome friends may \u201cmake it a beach day, something like that \u2013 start off the weekend very early\u201d, said Brendon Jonassaint, a first-year graduate student.\n\nChavira, a junior who is one of the organizers of the \u201cNo Nazis at University of Florida\u201d rally, said he understood if marginalized students made the choice to keep themselves safe and far away from the white supremacists. But white students, he said, had a responsibility to speak out against white nationalists on campus.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor those people who think ignoring fascism is a good idea, I would say it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the history of fascism in the 20s and 30s in Italy and Germany, it was those good, nice people who thought they didn\u2019t have to do anything, that Hitler was stupid, and that people would see how stupid he was.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are committed to nonviolence,\u201d Chavira added.",

        "content": "After much drama and a brief but technical government shutdown , Congress voted to fund the government at roughly 5:30 am Friday \u2014 keeping federal agencies open until the end of March .\nLawmakers extended government funding through March 23 in addition to passing a massive deal to increase investments in domestic programs and the military by roughly $ 300 billion over the next two years , and they increased the debt ceiling for one year . The bill passed at 71-28 in the Senate and 240-186 in the House with bipartisan support .\nCongress actually missed the deadline to fund the government Thursday night after Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) filibustered the spending and budget bill for increasing the national debt too much , technically allowing the government to run out of money for several hours .\nAnd that wasn \u2019 t the only contentious political back-and-forth of the night .\nHouse conservatives mounted a mini revolt when they , like Paul , raised concerns about the massive spending increase . This forced Republican leadership to seek Democratic support in the lower chamber .\nIt was a tough sell for House Democrats . The budget agreement sets aside the question of immigration and what to do about the sunsetting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program , which was at the heart of the standoff in January that ended in a three-day shutdown .\nLed by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , Democrats threatened to shut down the government if House Speaker Paul Ryan didn \u2019 t give assurances of a DACA fix vote . In the end , enough Democrats voted for the spending bill to offset the conservatives who didn \u2019 t vote for it . But they made sure Republicans sweated on the floor , withholding their support until the very last minute .\nPelosi censured Ryan on the House floor saying , \u201c For some reason , I think the speaker thinks he is the speaker of the White House rather than the speaker of the House . \u201d\nRyan , who has refused to give Pelosi firm assurances on immigration , says he will allow a DACA vote as long as it has the president \u2019 s blessing . But negotiations on immigration have largely stalled in the last month , stuck between the moderate-but-passable proposals that the White House won \u2019 t support and conservative Trump-endorsed proposals that won \u2019 t see the light of day in the Senate .\n\u201c My commitment to working together on an immigration measure we can make law is a sincere commitment . We will solve this DACA problem , \u201d Ryan said on the House floor before the vote .\nWith the contentious spending and budget debates off the docket , for now , lawmakers can focus on what will undoubtedly be a difficult immigration debate in the weeks ahead .\nCongress came to an agreement that will fund the government through March 23 . This will give congressional staff the time to write bigger appropriations bills that would actually fund the federal government under the parameters set by the new budget caps .\nThat will amount to significant increases in spending for domestic programs and the military over the next two years .\nExtend funding for the Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) for 10 years\nPut $ 6 billion in funding toward opioid and mental health treatment\nSet aside $ 5.8 billion for the bipartisan Child Care Development Block Grant\nPut $ 4 billion toward the Veterans Administration to rebuild and improve veterans hospitals and clinics\nSend $ 2 billion to research at the National Institutes of Health\nPut $ 20 billion toward infrastructure , including highways , water , wastewater , and rural broadband\nSet aside $ 4 billion for college affordability programs for police officers , teachers , and firefighters\nAnd add $ 7 billion in funding and a two-year reauthorization for community health centers\nThis budget deal is the result of a fight that goes back to 2011 when an Obama-era impasse over the debt ceiling brought the American economy to near calamity . It ultimately resulted in the 2013 sequester : across-the-board budget cuts and budget caps that would amount to $ 1.2 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years .\nCongress has repeatedly voted to raise the budget caps . Since the 2013 sequester , there have been two bipartisan deals to raise the caps by billions of dollars . The first in 2013 was forged between Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray ; a second was agreed on in 2015 . But those adjustments , which extended through fiscal year 2017 , had expired .\nWith these budget caps , appropriators \u2014 the lawmakers in charge of the nation \u2019 s purse strings \u2014 can begin putting together a trillion-dollar spending bill that would fund the government through next September .\nMeanwhile , the immigration debate still has a long way to go\nWhen Democrats and Republicans voted to reopen the government in late January , the idea was they would spend the following weeks cobbling together a deal on immigration and more permanent government spending in the weeks ahead .\nBut the actual legislative calendar shrank that window for negotiation , and talks have since increasingly splintered . Now Democrats have voted to fund the government again , hoping negotiations will focus on DACA .\nIn the Senate , Mitch McConnell \u2019 s much-anticipated \u2014 and very mysterious \u2014 immigration floor debate is expected to kick off next week . Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle hope the public negotiations will result in a bipartisan bill that addresses the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants currently protected from deportation .\nBut political headwinds in the House are stronger and remain largely unchanged .

        "content_original": "After much drama and a brief but technical government shutdown, Congress voted to fund the government at roughly 5:30 am Friday \u2014 keeping federal agencies open until the end of March.\n\nLawmakers extended government funding through March 23 in addition to passing a massive deal to increase investments in domestic programs and the military by roughly $300 billion over the next two years, and they increased the debt ceiling for one year. The bill passed at 71-28 in the Senate and 240-186 in the House with bipartisan support.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy.\n\nCongress actually missed the deadline to fund the government Thursday night after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) filibustered the spending and budget bill for increasing the national debt too much, technically allowing the government to run out of money for several hours.\n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t the only contentious political back-and-forth of the night.\n\nHouse conservatives mounted a mini revolt when they, like Paul, raised concerns about the massive spending increase. This forced Republican leadership to seek Democratic support in the lower chamber.\n\nIt was a tough sell for House Democrats. The budget agreement sets aside the question of immigration and what to do about the sunsetting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was at the heart of the standoff in January that ended in a three-day shutdown.\n\nLed by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Democrats threatened to shut down the government if House Speaker Paul Ryan didn\u2019t give assurances of a DACA fix vote. In the end, enough Democrats voted for the spending bill to offset the conservatives who didn\u2019t vote for it. But they made sure Republicans sweated on the floor, withholding their support until the very last minute.\n\nPelosi censured Ryan on the House floor saying, \u201cFor some reason, I think the speaker thinks he is the speaker of the White House rather than the speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nRyan, who has refused to give Pelosi firm assurances on immigration, says he will allow a DACA vote as long as it has the president\u2019s blessing. But negotiations on immigration have largely stalled in the last month, stuck between the moderate-but-passable proposals that the White House won\u2019t support and conservative Trump-endorsed proposals that won\u2019t see the light of day in the Senate.\n\n\u201cMy commitment to working together on an immigration measure we can make law is a sincere commitment. We will solve this DACA problem,\u201d Ryan said on the House floor before the vote.\n\nWith the contentious spending and budget debates off the docket, for now, lawmakers can focus on what will undoubtedly be a difficult immigration debate in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe short-term spending bill and massive budget deal, explained\n\nCongress came to an agreement that will fund the government through March 23. This will give congressional staff the time to write bigger appropriations bills that would actually fund the federal government under the parameters set by the new budget caps.\n\nThat will amount to significant increases in spending for domestic programs and the military over the next two years.\n\nSpecifically, the agreement will:\n\nExtend funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for 10 years\n\nFund community health centers for two years\n\nInclude $80 billion in disaster relief funding\n\nPut $6 billion in funding toward opioid and mental health treatment\n\nSet aside $5.8 billion for the bipartisan Child Care Development Block Grant\n\nPut $4 billion toward the Veterans Administration to rebuild and improve veterans hospitals and clinics\n\nSend $2 billion to research at the National Institutes of Health\n\nPut $20 billion toward infrastructure, including highways, water, wastewater, and rural broadband\n\nSet aside $4 billion for college affordability programs for police officers, teachers, and firefighters\n\nAnd add $7 billion in funding and a two-year reauthorization for community health centers\n\nThis budget deal is the result of a fight that goes back to 2011 when an Obama-era impasse over the debt ceiling brought the American economy to near calamity. It ultimately resulted in the 2013 sequester: across-the-board budget cuts and budget caps that would amount to $1.2 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years.\n\nCongress has repeatedly voted to raise the budget caps. Since the 2013 sequester, there have been two bipartisan deals to raise the caps by billions of dollars. The first in 2013 was forged between Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray; a second was agreed on in 2015. But those adjustments, which extended through fiscal year 2017, had expired.\n\nWith these budget caps, appropriators \u2014 the lawmakers in charge of the nation\u2019s purse strings \u2014 can begin putting together a trillion-dollar spending bill that would fund the government through next September.\n\nMeanwhile, the immigration debate still has a long way to go\n\nWhen Democrats and Republicans voted to reopen the government in late January, the idea was they would spend the following weeks cobbling together a deal on immigration and more permanent government spending in the weeks ahead.\n\nBut the actual legislative calendar shrank that window for negotiation, and talks have since increasingly splintered. Now Democrats have voted to fund the government again, hoping negotiations will focus on DACA.\n\nIn the Senate, Mitch McConnell\u2019s much-anticipated \u2014 and very mysterious \u2014 immigration floor debate is expected to kick off next week. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle hope the public negotiations will result in a bipartisan bill that addresses the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants currently protected from deportation.\n\nBut political headwinds in the House are stronger and remain largely unchanged. For weeks, conservative hardliners have commandeered immigration negotiations. To win enough House Republican votes for the short-term spending bill two weeks ago, Ryan promised the Freedom Caucus, the lower chamber\u2019s group of ultraconservatives, that Republican leadership would whip votes for a conservative immigration bill.\n\nConservatives continue to say there is a path to compromise, but they have shown no willingness to work with Democrats thus far. Ryan has said he will only bring up a bill for a vote if it has President Donald Trump\u2019s blessing, and if it has the support of the majority of the Republican conference \u2014 two contingencies that are hard to reconcile with what has to be a bipartisan DACA fix.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Trump\u2019s administration briefed Republican congressional aides on an immigration proposal that called for a path to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, $25 billion to fund a southern border wall, substantial curtailing of family immigration, and the elimination of the diversity visa lottery program, which would gut the legal immigration system.\n\nThe proposal was largely interpreted as a White House alternative to the one bipartisan proposal by Durbin and Sen.

South Korea had the capacity to carry out many more tests than the U.S. and also had learned lessons from prior SARS and MERS outbreaks .\nBut Bera said this sense of complacency also came because lawmakers had a lot of trust in the CDC based on its track record .\nThe agency \u2019 s reputation has taken a major hit from the coronavirus . The CDC initially designed a flawed test for COVID-19 , one of many missteps the administration made on testing .\n\u201c This is the CDC , \u201d Bera told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It never occurred to me that it would n't be the best test in the world . \u201d\nIn late January , House Democratic appropriators pushed the White House to seek an emergency supplemental measure dedicated to the coronavirus . The administration proposed $ 2.5 billion , which was immediately attacked as too meager .\nAfter some squabbling , Trump on March 6 signed an $ 8.3 billion supplemental as more than 200 people in the U.S. in 18 states had tested positive .\nThe $ 8.3 billion figure is a stunningly small amount in the wake of recent COVID-19 legislation . Since then , a total of nearly $ 3 trillion has been enacted \u2014 with House Democrats pushing for another $ 3 trillion in relief .\nCongress was far from the only institution or figure that can be accused of underestimating the crisis .\nIn January , the World Health Organization stated it \u201c doesn \u2019 t recommend limiting trade and movement \u201d and publicly praised China for its \u201c transparency \u201d and handling of the virus .\nAnthony Fauci Anthony FauciFauci says coronavirus his 'worst nightmare ' and far from over \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Coronavirus Report : Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan says there will be consequences from fraying US-China relations ; WHO walks back claims on asymptomatic spread of virus DC National Guard members called to respond to protests test positive for COVID-19 MORE , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) and one of the administration 's most trusted voices , said in late January that the American public shouldn \u2019 t worry about the coronavirus outbreak in China .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very , very low risk to the United States , \u201d Fauci said , while adding , public health officials need to take the virus \u201c very seriously . \u201d\nMany lawmakers understandably sought to soothe the public , including Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander Andrew ( Lamar ) Lamar AlexanderTrump tweets spark fresh headache for Republicans Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic : Where was Congress ?

Fewer than 100 cases had been confirmed in the U.S. at the time .\nEarlier , Democrats and the administration sparred over the Trump administration 's proposal to cut the budgets of public health agencies . The White House knew Congress was n't going to pass the cuts , which attracted criticism from some Republicans as well .\nRep.

Hillicon Valley : Conspiracy theories run rampant online amid Floyd protests | First lawsuit filed against Trump social media order | Snapchat to no longer promote Trump 's account Democratic lawmakers push leadership to ensure college students have internet access MORE ( D-Calif. ) , chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Health , pressed Azar in February about whether the administration should revise its budget plan for health agencies , citing the coronavirus and various proposed cuts .\nBattered by bad headlines , the Trump administration three weeks later upped its budget requests for CDC and NIAID by $ 1.3 billion and $ 440 million , respectively , which put them near current funding levels .\nThe coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. during a historically divisive political moment that has contributed to a faulty response by the government .\nTrump mentioned the coronavirus in his Feb. 4 State of the Union address , which began with him refusing to shake Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiSanders endorses Engel challenger in New York primary \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Morning Report - Dems , GOP already headed in different directions on policing reforms Biden , Democrats seek to shut down calls to defund police MORE \u2019 s ( D-Calif. ) hand and ended with her ripping up a copy of his speech .\nThe address was given a day before the Senate voted to acquit Trump on impeachment charges .\nTrump touched on the virus briefly in a paragraph sandwiched between opioid abuse and AIDS . And he sounded a positive note toward China , something that would dramatically change in subsequent weeks .\n\u201c Protecting Americans \u2019 health also means fighting infectious diseases , \u201d he said . \u201c We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China . My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat . \u201d\nFrom early to mid-February , the Trump administration was regularly briefing Congress on the spread of the virus . But it refused early requests to appear publicly in the House and Senate . The administration did not appear at the first House hearing on Feb. 5 and also declined to testify before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee a week later .\nSen. Ron Johnson Ronald ( Ron ) Harold JohnsonExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic : Where was Congress ? GOP 's Obama-era probes fuel Senate angst Graham postpones Russia probe subpoena vote as tensions boil over MORE ( R-Wis. ) , an ally of the president who chairs the Senate panel , said he was `` disappointed '' the administration did n't send any representatives .\nA former Trump administration official , Scott Gottlieb , told Johnson 's committee that the coronavirus was \u201c deeply concerning. \u201d Gottlieb , who headed the Food and Drug Administration , said , \u201c I think what we should be worried about is n't the cases we know about . It 's the cases that we do n't know about . And there are certainly cases we do n't know about . \u201d\nThere were 13 confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases at that point .\nDemocratic leaders , including Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerSchumer on Trump 's tweet about 75-year-old protester : He 'should go back to hiding in the bunker ' Democrats unveil sweeping legislation in response to protests of police brutality Pelosi , Schumer kneel in silence for almost 9 minutes to honor George Floyd MORE ( D-N.Y. ) , have lambasted Trump 's handling of the virus .\nTrump and other Republicans have noted that Pelosi visited San Francisco \u2019 s Chinatown in late February , encouraging people to go there to eat and shop . Fact-checkers have noted Trump \u2019 s subsequent comments about that press event significantly exaggerated what she said .\nPelosi in May said Trump should not be taking hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus given that he is `` morbidly obese , '' a personal insult out of character for the Speaker . Trump has called her \u201c crazy Nancy \u201d and accused her of drinking on the job .\nLawmakers and Trump were able to come together to pass massive bills to help the economy in March , though they are now at loggerheads on a new relief bill even as millions more Americans file for unemployment .\nIt has all highlighted how the broad bipartisanship after national crises \u2014 such as 9/11 \u2014 are likely a thing of the past . Sweeping reforms to the law , including ObamaCare and the Trump tax cuts , are rammed through on a partisan basis . Oversight of the executive branch by the opposing party is now marked by defying subpoenas and drawn-out battles in the courts .\nRoss K. Baker , a professor of political science at Rutgers University who has served as a Senate fellow , said there were no powerful heroes on Capitol Hill who saw what was coming . He also pointed out both parties were preoccupied with impeachment in the beginning of the year as the virus spread around the globe .\nWhile noting that the executive branch is most responsible for combating a pandemic , Baker said the White House has been usurping power from Congress since the 19th century . That dynamic , he said , has basically left the legislative branch watching from the sidelines .\nBy and large , the initial reaction from the Democratic-led House and the Republican-controlled Senate was similar . The narrative on Capitol Hill was the virus would likely affect the U.S. , but the country 's health care system was the best in the world and the experts were on top of it .\nMany comparisons were made to the flu as legislators noted the flu kills tens of thousands of people in America per year . Others said the coronavirus was primarily a threat to the sick and the elderly .\nAfter Trump administration officials gave the Senate a classified briefing on the coronavirus on Feb. 25 , Democrats and Republicans both questioned the need for the information to be labeled secret .\nYet the reaction of the parties was overall quite different . Republican senators generally expressed optimism to the press on the federal response , noting that outside of a cruise ship , U.S. cases had held steady at 14 for roughly a week . Democrats , such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( Conn. ) , raised significant concerns .\nBlumenthal , a frequent critic of Trump , said an outbreak in the U.S. was \u201c virtually inevitable. \u201d He added there would be an outcry if the American people \u201c heard what we were told . \u201d\nWhile many Republicans were downplaying the threat , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles ( Chuck ) Ernest GrassleyOn The Money : Key Democrat accuses Labor chief of 'misleading ' testimony | Warren urges bank regulator to scrap anti-redlining rule rewrite | Senators press IG to act to prevent nursing homes from seizing coronavirus checks Key Democrat accuses Labor head of 'misleading ' testimony on jobless benefits Senators press IG to act to prevent nursing homes from seizing coronavirus checks MORE ( R-Iowa ) took a different tack : \u201c While the coronavirus is not yet a pandemic , there are signs that it could develop into a worldwide threat . Based on public reports , I \u2019 m concerned that China may not be accurately reflecting the scale or scope of the problem or sharing information with global health organizations . \u201d\nThe stock market plummeted that day with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 880 points in a spiral that would continue for weeks .\nEven though U.S. policymakers were late to comprehend the severity of COVID-19 , Baker said they did come together to pass massive bills on relief packages relatively quickly .\nGoing forward , Baker is optimistic that the White House and Congress will strike one more deal on another major stimulus measure .\nAfter that , Baker said , \u201c We 'll be deep in the presidential election season . \u201d",

GOP's Obama-era probes fuel Senate angst MORE (Vt.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee who is the dean of the upper chamber, delivered a Feb. 12 speech on the Senate floor that called for funding hikes, highlighting the 2020 outbreaks of Ebola and the coronavirus. Leahy didn't forecast how bad the coronavirus would become, but he recognized the potential scope of spreading diseases.\n\n\u201cToday, we are struggling to control outbreaks of Ebola and the novel coronavirus,\u201d Leahy said, \u201cand while we don\u2019t know which viruses will next attack us, we do know it is not a matter of if, but when ... Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of lives could be lost, and the amount of funding necessary to control it would be incalculable.\u201d\n\nLater on, lawmakers were pinpointing problems early that would become national outrages.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis Nadler Floyd's brother to testify in front of House Judiciary Committee hearing on police brutality House Judiciary Committee to hold hearing on police brutality next week House Judiciary to hear whistleblowers on 'politicization' of Justice Dept under Trump MORE (D-N.Y.) on March 12 urged the administration to take precautions to protect people who are incarcerated two weeks before the first prisoner died.

It was a wonky piece of legislation that attracted scant attention in the media and was quietly signed into law by the president.\n\nYet, it was hailed by both parties as increasing the nation's preparedness for chemical or biological attacks, natural disasters and infectious diseases. But the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA) did little to stave off the coronavirus.\n\nAs the coronavirus news got worse, there was frustration among some members that they had already enacted a recent law to control such a disease.\n\nSen. Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? Trump asserts his power over Republicans FISA 'reform': Groundhog Day edition MORE (R-N.C.), a co-author of PAHPA who sits on the HELP panel, pressed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March on the implementation of the 2019 law \u2014 specifically on the allocation of the money that Congress approved. Burr would later step aside as chairman of the Intelligence Committee amid an investigation of his pre-pandemic stock sales.\n\nWeeks before it became clear to much of the public just how far behind the U.S. was on tests, lawmakers were raising the alarm.\n\nSen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said at the March 3 hearing, \u201cIt's inadequate, to say the least.\u201d\n\nSen. Patty Murray Patricia (Patty) Lynn MurrayA national testing strategy to safely reopen America Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? The coronavirus crisis has cut the child care sector MORE (Wash.), the top Democrat on HELP whose home state was the first one hit, grilled Trump administration officials on testing and was skeptical of their early promises, which weren't met.\n\nIn late February, Murray pointedly asked Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, \u201cIs our country ready?\u201d\n\nBera told The Hill that policymakers had a false sense of complacency, partially because of early positive data coming from South Korea's handling of the outbreak. South Korea had the capacity to carry out many more tests than the U.S. and also had learned lessons from prior SARS and MERS outbreaks.\n\nBut Bera said this sense of complacency also came because lawmakers had a lot of trust in the CDC based on its track record.\n\nThe agency\u2019s reputation has taken a major hit from the coronavirus. The CDC initially designed a flawed test for COVID-19, one of many missteps the administration made on testing.\n\n\u201cThis is the CDC,\u201d Bera told The Hill. \u201cIt never occurred to me that it wouldn't be the best test in the world.\u201d\n\nBudget battles underscore how Congress underestimated threat\n\nIn late January, House Democratic appropriators pushed the White House to seek an emergency supplemental measure dedicated to the coronavirus. The administration proposed $2.5 billion, which was immediately attacked as too meager.\n\nAfter some squabbling, Trump on March 6 signed an $8.3 billion supplemental as more than 200 people in the U.S. in 18 states had tested positive.\n\nThe $8.3 billion figure is a stunningly small amount in the wake of recent COVID-19 legislation. Since then, a total of nearly $3 trillion has been enacted \u2014 with House Democrats pushing for another $3 trillion in relief.\n\nCongress was far from the only institution or figure that can be accused of underestimating the crisis.\n\nIn January, the World Health Organization stated it \u201cdoesn\u2019t recommend limiting trade and movement\u201d and publicly praised China for its \u201ctransparency\u201d and handling of the virus.\n\nAnthony Fauci Anthony FauciFauci says coronavirus his 'worst nightmare' and far from over The Hill's Coronavirus Report: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan says there will be consequences from fraying US-China relations; WHO walks back claims on asymptomatic spread of virus DC National Guard members called to respond to protests test positive for COVID-19 MORE, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and one of the administration's most trusted voices, said in late January that the American public shouldn\u2019t worry about the coronavirus outbreak in China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very low risk to the United States,\u201d Fauci said, while adding, public health officials need to take the virus \u201cvery seriously.\u201d\n\nMany lawmakers understandably sought to soothe the public, including Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderTrump tweets spark fresh headache for Republicans Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? Murkowski, Mattis criticism ratchets up pressure on GOP over Trump MORE (R-Tenn.).\n\nAt the March 3 HELP hearing, Alexander read from a front-page New York Times story stating, \u201cWith its top-notch scientists, modern hospitals and sprawling public health infrastructure, most experts agree, the United States is among the countries best prepared to prevent or manage such an epidemic.\u201d\n\nWhile the article also raised the possibility that the U.S. could experience shortages in ventilators and personal protective equipment, Alexander stressed the need to get accurate information for the public. Fewer than 100 cases had been confirmed in the U.S. at the time.\n\nEarlier, Democrats and the administration sparred over the Trump administration's proposal to cut the budgets of public health agencies. The White House knew Congress wasn't going to pass the cuts, which attracted criticism from some Republicans as well.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo Anna Georges EshooExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? Hillicon Valley: Conspiracy theories run rampant online amid Floyd protests | First lawsuit filed against Trump social media order | Snapchat to no longer promote Trump's account Democratic lawmakers push leadership to ensure college students have internet access MORE (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Health, pressed Azar in February about whether the administration should revise its budget plan for health agencies, citing the coronavirus and various proposed cuts.\n\n\u201cNothing to reconsider?\u201d Eshoo asked.\n\n\u201cI don't believe there is,\u201d Azar responded.\n\nBattered by bad headlines, the Trump administration three weeks later upped its budget requests for CDC and NIAID by $1.3 billion and $440 million, respectively, which put them near current funding levels.\n\nPartisan battles\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. during a historically divisive political moment that has contributed to a faulty response by the government.\n\nTrump mentioned the coronavirus in his Feb. 4 State of the Union address, which began with him refusing to shake Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiSanders endorses Engel challenger in New York primary The Hill's Morning Report - Dems, GOP already headed in different directions on policing reforms Biden, Democrats seek to shut down calls to defund police MORE\u2019s (D-Calif.) hand and ended with her ripping up a copy of his speech.\n\nThe address was given a day before the Senate voted to acquit Trump on impeachment charges.\n\nTrump touched on the virus briefly in a paragraph sandwiched between opioid abuse and AIDS. And he sounded a positive note toward China, something that would dramatically change in subsequent weeks.\n\n\u201cProtecting Americans\u2019 health also means fighting infectious diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China. My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.\u201d\n\nFrom early to mid-February, the Trump administration was regularly briefing Congress on the spread of the virus. But it refused early requests to appear publicly in the House and Senate. The administration did not appear at the first House hearing on Feb. 5 and also declined to testify before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee a week later.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? GOP's Obama-era probes fuel Senate angst Graham postpones Russia probe subpoena vote as tensions boil over MORE (R-Wis.), an ally of the president who chairs the Senate panel, said he was \"disappointed\" the administration didn't send any representatives.\n\nA former Trump administration official, Scott Gottlieb, told Johnson's committee that the coronavirus was \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d Gottlieb, who headed the Food and Drug Administration, said, \u201cI think what we should be worried about isn't the cases we know about. It's the cases that we don't know about. And there are certainly cases we don't know about.\u201d\n\nThere were 13 confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases at that point.\n\nDemocratic leaders, including Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerSchumer on Trump's tweet about 75-year-old protester: He 'should go back to hiding in the bunker' Democrats unveil sweeping legislation in response to protests of police brutality Pelosi, Schumer kneel in silence for almost 9 minutes to honor George Floyd MORE (D-N.Y.), have lambasted Trump's handling of the virus.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have noted that Pelosi visited San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown in late February, encouraging people to go there to eat and shop. Fact-checkers have noted Trump\u2019s subsequent comments about that press event significantly exaggerated what she said.\n\nPelosi in May said Trump should not be taking hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus given that he is \"morbidly obese,\" a personal insult out of character for the Speaker. Trump has called her \u201ccrazy Nancy\u201d and accused her of drinking on the job.\n\nLawmakers and Trump were able to come together to pass massive bills to help the economy in March, though they are now at loggerheads on a new relief bill even as millions more Americans file for unemployment.\n\nIt has all highlighted how the broad bipartisanship after national crises \u2014 such as 9/11 \u2014 are likely a thing of the past. Sweeping reforms to the law, including ObamaCare and the Trump tax cuts, are rammed through on a partisan basis. Oversight of the executive branch by the opposing party is now marked by defying subpoenas and drawn-out battles in the courts.\n\nNo heroes\n\nRoss K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University who has served as a Senate fellow, said there were no powerful heroes on Capitol Hill who saw what was coming. He also pointed out both parties were preoccupied with impeachment in the beginning of the year as the virus spread around the globe.\n\nWhile noting that the executive branch is most responsible for combating a pandemic, Baker said the White House has been usurping power from Congress since the 19th century. That dynamic, he said, has basically left the legislative branch watching from the sidelines.\n\nBy and large, the initial reaction from the Democratic-led House and the Republican-controlled Senate was similar. The narrative on Capitol Hill was the virus would likely affect the U.S., but the country's health care system was the best in the world and the experts were on top of it.\n\nMany comparisons were made to the flu as legislators noted the flu kills tens of thousands of people in America per year. Others said the coronavirus was primarily a threat to the sick and the elderly.\n\nAfter Trump administration officials gave the Senate a classified briefing on the coronavirus on Feb. 25, Democrats and Republicans both questioned the need for the information to be labeled secret.\n\nYet the reaction of the parties was overall quite different. Republican senators generally expressed optimism to the press on the federal response, noting that outside of a cruise ship, U.S. cases had held steady at 14 for roughly a week. Democrats, such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), raised significant concerns.\n\nBlumenthal, a frequent critic of Trump, said an outbreak in the U.S. was \u201cvirtually inevitable.\u201d He added there would be an outcry if the American people \u201cheard what we were told.\u201d\n\nWhile many Republicans were downplaying the threat, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyOn The Money: Key Democrat accuses Labor chief of 'misleading' testimony | Warren urges bank regulator to scrap anti-redlining rule rewrite | Senators press IG to act to prevent nursing homes from seizing coronavirus checks Key Democrat accuses Labor head of 'misleading' testimony on jobless benefits Senators press IG to act to prevent nursing homes from seizing coronavirus checks MORE (R-Iowa) took a different tack: \u201cWhile the coronavirus is not yet a pandemic, there are signs that it could develop into a worldwide threat. Based on public reports, I\u2019m concerned that China may not be accurately reflecting the scale or scope of the problem or sharing information with global health organizations.\u201d\n\nThe stock market plummeted that day with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 880 points in a spiral that would continue for weeks.\n\nEven though U.S. policymakers were late to comprehend the severity of COVID-19, Baker said they did come together to pass massive bills on relief packages relatively quickly.\n\nGoing forward, Baker is optimistic that the White House and Congress will strike one more deal on another major stimulus measure.\n\nAfter that, Baker said, \u201cWe'll be deep in the presidential election season.\u201d",

        "content": "Days before Super Tuesday , a potent hashtag appeared on Twitter : # NeverTrump .\nIt was , Republican opponents of Donald Trump said at the time , a last-ditch rallying cry to prevent the mercurial billionaire from winning the GOP presidential nomination and effectively taking over the party .\nFive weeks later , # NeverTrump is still trending \u2013 and the Republican movement to derail the \u201c Trump train \u201d faces its moment of truth Tuesday in the Wisconsin primary . Conservative groups have spent millions of dollars on television and radio attack ads . Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , a onetime contender for the nomination , has rallied support for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , Mr. Trump \u2019 s top opponent . In Milwaukee , whose suburbs are rich with Republican voters , conservative talk radio hosts have been skewering Trump relentlessly .\n\u201c Honestly , If Donald Trump does win in Wisconsin , I don \u2019 t know how he \u2019 s possibly stoppable , \u201d says Charlie Sykes , Wisconsin \u2019 s top conservative radio voice , speaking Monday on MSNBC .\n\u201c But I do think that people are going to look back at Wisconsin and say , \u2018 All right , this is exactly what it will take to stop Donald Trump from being the Republican nominee . \u2019 \u201d\nThere are indications that Wisconsin could indeed slow Trump \u2019 s momentum . One key poll has Senator Cruz 10 points up .\nFor his part , Mr. Sykes says the lead-up to Wisconsin has uncovered a \u201c formula \u201d for stopping Trump that includes a new willingness by the media to drill down on issues with Trump \u2013 as MSNBC host Chris Matthews did last week on abortion . Trump said he believed women should be punished for having abortions , then quickly reversed himself after an uproar ensued .\nBut many of Wisconsin \u2019 s lessons about how to beat Trump are particular to the state . Its deeply ingrained sense of civility , as well as its relatively higher levels of education and religious adherence , all play to Trump \u2019 s weaknesses .\nIn the end , Wisconsin \u2019 s biggest contribution to the # NeverTrump movement could simply be in denying him the delegates he needs to win a majority by the Republican National Convention this summer . At the convention , Trump \u2019 s chances of securing the nomination will plummet if he can \u2019 t do it on the first ballot .\nIn Wisconsin , Trump has been his own worst enemy , with a brash style that clashes with the state \u2019 s culture of civility .\n\u201c Even when Scott Walker was battling the unions [ in 2011 ] and 100,000 people were marching around the capitol , those were family-friendly events , \u201d says Barry Burden , a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin , Madison . \u201c There were massive policy disagreements , but not a lot of personal insults . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s recent retweet of an unflattering picture of Cruz \u2019 s wife , Heidi , is just one example of his tone-deaf approach in Wisconsin , the only state voting Tuesday . Trump \u2019 s repeated attacks on Walker and on the Republican speaker of the House , Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , have also baffled observers , as both men are popular among the state \u2019 s Republicans .\nTrump is running into the buzzsaw of a state GOP that coalesced around Walker during his clashes with public unions and the subsequent recall election in 2012 , which the governor survived , followed by his reelection in 2014 .\n\u201c That means there \u2019 s not a rump group of the party ready to bolt to go to Trump , \u201d says Charles Franklin , director of the Marquette University Law School poll . Last week , the poll showed Cruz beating Trump , 40 to 30 percent .\nOn the plus side for Trump , Wisconsin does not register voters by party and allows same-day registration . So first-time or infrequent voters inspired by Trump \u2019 s message can easily turn out for him .\nUltimately , observers still expect Cruz to win , though there are important demographic reasons not to put too much stock in a Cruz victory . Nate Cohn , a specialist on voter analytics at The New York Times , points to several factors that have always spelled trouble for Trump in Wisconsin , including :\nEducation . The state is average or above average in every educational category , while support for Trump skews toward those with less education . Wisconsin is unusual in that \u201c many of its most strongly Republican areas are well-educated suburbs , \u201d Mr. Cohn notes .\nReligion . Wisconsin is also a bit above average for religious adherence , and \u201c with the exception of white Roman Catholics , Trump fares worse in areas where larger shares of the population are reported to be religious adherents , \u201d Cohn writes .\nFamily .

        "content_original": "Days before Super Tuesday, a potent hashtag appeared on Twitter: #NeverTrump.\n\nIt was, Republican opponents of Donald Trump said at the time, a last-ditch rallying cry to prevent the mercurial billionaire from winning the GOP presidential nomination and effectively taking over the party.\n\nFive weeks later, #NeverTrump is still trending \u2013 and the Republican movement to derail the \u201cTrump train\u201d faces its moment of truth Tuesday in the Wisconsin primary. Conservative groups have spent millions of dollars on television and radio attack ads. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a onetime contender for the nomination, has rallied support for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump\u2019s top opponent. In Milwaukee, whose suburbs are rich with Republican voters, conservative talk radio hosts have been skewering Trump relentlessly.\n\nThe hour is late, Trump opponents warn.\n\n\u201cHonestly, If Donald Trump does win in Wisconsin, I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s possibly stoppable,\u201d says Charlie Sykes, Wisconsin\u2019s top conservative radio voice, speaking Monday on MSNBC.\n\n\u201cBut I do think that people are going to look back at Wisconsin and say, \u2018All right, this is exactly what it will take to stop Donald Trump from being the Republican nominee.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere are indications that Wisconsin could indeed slow Trump\u2019s momentum. One key poll has Senator Cruz 10 points up.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Sykes says the lead-up to Wisconsin has uncovered a \u201cformula\u201d for stopping Trump that includes a new willingness by the media to drill down on issues with Trump \u2013 as MSNBC host Chris Matthews did last week on abortion. Trump said he believed women should be punished for having abortions, then quickly reversed himself after an uproar ensued.\n\nBut many of Wisconsin\u2019s lessons about how to beat Trump are particular to the state. Its deeply ingrained sense of civility, as well as its relatively higher levels of education and religious adherence, all play to Trump\u2019s weaknesses.\n\nIn the end, Wisconsin\u2019s biggest contribution to the #NeverTrump movement could simply be in denying him the delegates he needs to win a majority by the Republican National Convention this summer. At the convention, Trump\u2019s chances of securing the nomination will plummet if he can\u2019t do it on the first ballot.\n\nStyle and incivility\n\nIn Wisconsin, Trump has been his own worst enemy, with a brash style that clashes with the state\u2019s culture of civility.\n\n\u201cEven when Scott Walker was battling the unions [in 2011] and 100,000 people were marching around the capitol, those were family-friendly events,\u201d says Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. \u201cThere were massive policy disagreements, but not a lot of personal insults.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s recent retweet of an unflattering picture of Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, is just one example of his tone-deaf approach in Wisconsin, the only state voting Tuesday. Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on Walker and on the Republican speaker of the House, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, have also baffled observers, as both men are popular among the state\u2019s Republicans.\n\nTrump is running into the buzzsaw of a state GOP that coalesced around Walker during his clashes with public unions and the subsequent recall election in 2012, which the governor survived, followed by his reelection in 2014.\n\n\u201cThat means there\u2019s not a rump group of the party ready to bolt to go to Trump,\u201d says Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette University Law School poll. Last week, the poll showed Cruz beating Trump, 40 to 30 percent.\n\nOn the plus side for Trump, Wisconsin does not register voters by party and allows same-day registration. So first-time or infrequent voters inspired by Trump\u2019s message can easily turn out for him.\n\nUltimately, observers still expect Cruz to win, though there are important demographic reasons not to put too much stock in a Cruz victory. Nate Cohn, a specialist on voter analytics at The New York Times, points to several factors that have always spelled trouble for Trump in Wisconsin, including:\n\nEducation. The state is average or above average in every educational category, while support for Trump skews toward those with less education. Wisconsin is unusual in that \u201cmany of its most strongly Republican areas are well-educated suburbs,\u201d Mr. Cohn notes.\n\nReligion. Wisconsin is also a bit above average for religious adherence, and \u201cwith the exception of white Roman Catholics, Trump fares worse in areas where larger shares of the population are reported to be religious adherents,\u201d Cohn writes.\n\nFamily. Trump also fares worse in areas with strong traditional families; Wisconsin has an above-average number of married couples.\n\nAncestry. Wisconsin\u2019s population skews toward those from \u201cpredominantly Protestant countries in Northern Europe,\u201d a demographic in which Trump has struggled, Cohn reports.\n\nIn short, Wisconsin Republicans are similar demographically to those in Iowa, Kansas, and Utah, all states where Cruz beat Trump \u2013 who then rebounded.\n\nRoad to the convention\n\nThe key for Trump will be to recover quickly if he loses Wisconsin. The calendar both helps and hurts him. The next contest isn\u2019t until April 19, so he potentially faces two weeks of being cast as a loser. The good news for him is that the next contests are on friendlier turf \u2013 his home state of New York, followed by Pennsylvania.\n\nBut if Trump loses Wisconsin badly enough that he earns no delegates, his path to clinching the Republican nomination before the convention becomes steeper. Then, his biggest failing as a candidate \u2013 his weak organization \u2013 could come into play.\n\nHe has a dearth of insiders both nationally and inside the state parties who can defend his interests in delegate allocation.\n\nTrump has already reportedly been losing delegates to Cruz, whose operation is going after those who are uncommitted or won by candidates no longer in the race.\n\nTrump has attempted to address this by bringing in veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort to wrangle delegates at the convention, a major \u201cget.\u201d\n\nThe third remaining GOP candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, remains an important factor, preventing Trump and Cruz from going against each other one-on-one. Governor Kasich appears to have benefited from the departure of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio from the race March 15.

But for some Wisconsin voters, Kasich is an important option \u2013 the only candidate left with executive branch governing experience and more-moderate Republican policies.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, told USA TODAY he spoke to the Trump\u2019s chief of staff Friday and was promised the president would not use disaster relief funding to pay for the wall.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve assured us that they\u2019re not going to take relief for (Hurricane) Harvey survivors,\u201d Crenshaw said, later adding that the administration would not take funding from Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, all places hit by hurricanes.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said he didn't think money would be diverted, \"But if some reason they try, I will do everything I can to overturn such a decision.\"\n\nOther Republicans worry about the precedent a declaration would set for future presidents to declare emergencies based on their own campaign promises \u2013 though they insist Trump is correct that there is a crisis at the border.\n\n\u201cI would be concerned about the slippery slope that, you know, any national emergency could create. That being said, I think these are uniquely different in terms of what it is and the language that is in statute that you would address,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, a staunch conservative and Trump ally who speaks to the president frequently.\n\nEven if the president declares a national emergency, the government does not automatically reopen. The House and Senate will still have to pass legislation to fund the remaining government agencies, however, many assume that would happen without the issue of wall funding as a sticking point.\n\n\u201cThere is not a national emergency, there\u2019s a challenge at the border, we ought to meet it\u201d by reopening government and then \u201cnegotiate further on border security,\u201d Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told USA TODAY.\n\nHoyer said if Trump did declare a national emergency, Democrats would need to figure out if they wanted to keep the bills they\u2019ve already passed to reopen the government or send through different bills.\n\nHoyer said that after the government was reopened, Democrats would look at legal challenges to such a declaration.\n\nSome Democrats said Trump would have a hard time proving that it\u2019s a national emergency.\n\nWhile some continued to call on Trump to sign federal funding legislation, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said: \u201clet\u2019s fight it out in court.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this is what they need in order to save face and allow us to reopen the government, then, by all means, let\u2019s have at it,\u201d said Raskin, who has a large number of federal workers and contractors in his district. \u201cPeople are hurting. People are texting me their pay stub which says \u2018zero dollars gross pay, zero dollars net pay.\u2019 I\u2019ve got many constituents who are not going to be able to pay their mortgage this month because of what the president has done.\u201d\n\nContributing: Nicole Gaudiano, John Fritze, Michael Collins\n\nMore:Today should be payday for thousands of government workers.

        "content_original": "National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday that President Trump\u2019s United Nations speech will focus on promoting and protecting American prosperity and suggested that the White House\u2019s National Security Council is better after having removed adviser Steve Bannon and others who pushed \u201ctheir own narrow agendas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Security Council, I think, has served the president well in bringing him multiple options. There were some who tried to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas. And that didn\u2019t serve the president well,\u201d McMaster told \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d in response to questions about his policy clashes with Bannon.\n\nMcMaster, shortly after becoming the White House national security adviser in February, removed Bannon as an official member of the council. And Bannon was ousted last month as the president\u2019s top political adviser, after retired Marine Corps Gen.

        "content": "In a concurrence with the court \u2019 s liberal justices this week , Gorsuch laid the groundwork for a restoration of constitutional order .\nLast week , one week after the first anniversary of Neil Gorsuch \u2019 s ascension to the Supreme Court , he delivered an opinion that was excellent as it pertained to the case at issue and momentous in its implications pertaining to the institutional tangle known as the administrative state . If he can persuade his fellow court conservatives to see why they were mistaken in disagreeing with him , and if he can persuade his liberal colleagues to follow the logic of their decision with which he concurred , the judiciary will begin restoring constitutional equilibrium . It will limit Congress \u2019 s imprecise legislating that requires excessive unguided improvising by all those involved in seeing that the laws are \u201c faithfully \u201d executed .\nIn 1992 , when James Dimaya , a Philippine citizen , was 13 , he became a lawful permanent resident of the United States , where , unfortunately , his behavior has been less than lawful : In 2007 and 2009 , he was convicted of residential burglary . The Department of Homeland Security says he should be deported because he committed a \u201c crime of violence , \u201d hence covered by a portion of immigration law that , after listing specific crimes ( rape , murder , etc . ) , adds a catch-all category of crimes involving \u201c a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense. \u201d How are judges supposed to apply this ?\nWriting for the majority in a 5\u20134 decision \u2014 and joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , and Sonia Sotomayor ( with Gorsuch concurring in the judgment and much of the opinion ) \u2014 Elena Kagan wrote : The law \u2019 s category , a \u201c crime of violence , \u201d is so indeterminate ( \u201c fuzzy , \u201d she said ) that deporting Dimaya under it would violate the Constitution \u2019 s \u201c due process of law \u201d guarantee . Vague laws beget two evils that are related : They do not give citizens reasonably clear notice of what behavior is proscribed or prescribed . And they give \u2014 actually , require of \u2014 judges and law-enforcement officials excessive discretion in improvising a fuzzy law \u2019 s meaning . In agreeing with this ( and disagreeing with John Roberts , Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas , and Samuel Alito ) , Gorsuch wrote :\nVague laws \u201c invite the exercise of arbitrary power \u201d by \u201c leaving the people in the dark about what the law demands and allowing prosecutors and courts to make it up. \u201d The lack of \u201c precise and sufficient certainty \u201d ( criteria stipulated by the English jurist William Blackstone , whose writings influenced the Constitution \u2019 s Framers ) invites \u201c more unpredictability and arbitrariness \u201d than is constitutional . Furthermore , the crux of America \u2019 s constitutional architecture , the separation of powers , is implicated . All legislative power is vested in Congress .

        "content_original": "Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nIn a concurrence with the court\u2019s liberal justices this week, Gorsuch laid the groundwork for a restoration of constitutional order.\n\nLast week, one week after the first anniversary of Neil Gorsuch\u2019s ascension to the Supreme Court, he delivered an opinion that was excellent as it pertained to the case at issue and momentous in its implications pertaining to the institutional tangle known as the administrative state. If he can persuade his fellow court conservatives to see why they were mistaken in disagreeing with him, and if he can persuade his liberal colleagues to follow the logic of their decision with which he concurred, the judiciary will begin restoring constitutional equilibrium. It will limit Congress\u2019s imprecise legislating that requires excessive unguided improvising by all those involved in seeing that the laws are \u201cfaithfully\u201d executed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1992, when James Dimaya, a Philippine citizen, was 13, he became a lawful permanent resident of the United States, where, unfortunately, his behavior has been less than lawful: In 2007 and 2009, he was convicted of residential burglary. The Department of Homeland Security says he should be deported because he committed a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d hence covered by a portion of immigration law that, after listing specific crimes (rape, murder, etc.), adds a catch-all category of crimes involving \u201ca substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d How are judges supposed to apply this?\n\nWriting for the majority in a 5\u20134 decision \u2014 and joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor (with Gorsuch concurring in the judgment and much of the opinion) \u2014 Elena Kagan wrote: The law\u2019s category, a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d is so indeterminate (\u201cfuzzy,\u201d she said) that deporting Dimaya under it would violate the Constitution\u2019s \u201cdue process of law\u201d guarantee. Vague laws beget two evils that are related: They do not give citizens reasonably clear notice of what behavior is proscribed or prescribed. And they give \u2014 actually, require of \u2014 judges and law-enforcement officials excessive discretion in improvising a fuzzy law\u2019s meaning. In agreeing with this (and disagreeing with John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito), Gorsuch wrote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVague laws \u201cinvite the exercise of arbitrary power\u201d by \u201cleaving the people in the dark about what the law demands and allowing prosecutors and courts to make it up.\u201d The lack of \u201cprecise and sufficient certainty\u201d (criteria stipulated by the English jurist William Blackstone, whose writings influenced the Constitution\u2019s Framers) invites \u201cmore unpredictability and arbitrariness\u201d than is constitutional. Furthermore, the crux of America\u2019s constitutional architecture, the separation of powers, is implicated. All legislative power is vested in Congress. The judicial power, Gorsuch wrote, \u201cdoes not license judges to craft new laws\u201d but only to discern and follow an existing law\u2019s prescribed course. With the fuzzy \u201ccrime of violence\u201d category, Congress abdicated its \u201cresponsibilities for setting the standards of the criminal law.\u201d So, allowing vague laws would allow Congress \u201cto hand off the job of lawmaking.\u201d Hence such laws not only illegitimately transfer power to police and prosecutors but also would \u201cleave it all to a judicial hunch.\u201d\n\nThe principle Gorsuch enunciates here regarding one provision of immigration law is a scythe sharp enough to slice through many practices of the administrative state, which translates often vague congressional sentiments into binding rules, a practice indistinguishable from legislating.\n\nThe principle Gorsuch enunciates here regarding one provision of immigration law is a scythe sharp enough to slice through many practices of the administrative state, which translates often vague congressional sentiments into binding rules, a practice indistinguishable from legislating.
