        "content": "Scorecard For A Departing President : Assessing Obama 's Successes And Shortcomings\nPresident Obama will address the nation for what 's likely to be the last time Tuesday night . He says the prime-time address from his adopted hometown of Chicago will be a chance to celebrate the successes of the past eight years and to offer some thoughts on where the nation goes from here .\nThe celebration could be short-lived . While Obama can rightfully boast about a vastly improved economy and other changes during his tenure , the man who 's taking his place in the Oval Office has promised to reverse much of what Obama accomplished . And while the president remains personally popular , his Democratic Party is weaker than it was eight years ago , reducing its chances of protecting Obama 's legacy .\nThe president outlined the highlights of that legacy in an open letter to the American people last week . `` By so many measures , our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started , '' he wrote .\nHere 's a scorecard of some of the measures the president cited , along with some he left off :\n`` An economy that was shrinking at more than 8 percent is now growing at more than 3 percent , '' Obama wrote in his letter . `` Businesses that were bleeding jobs unleashed the longest streak of job creation on record . ''\nPresident Obama took office in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . He leaves with an unemployment rate less than half of what it was during the depths of the downturn .\nU.S. employers have added more than 11 million jobs since Obama took office ( and more than 15 million since the job market bottomed out in early 2010 ) . After nearly a decade of stagnant wages , median household income jumped sharply in 2015 . And last year 's wage growth was the strongest of the recovery .\n`` There 's the sort of rule about how you 're supposed to go , leave the forest nicer than you found it , '' White House economist Jason Furman said last week . `` President Obama is definitely handing over an economy in much , much better shape than the economy he inherited . ''\nThe Recovery Act Obama pushed through Congress less than a month after taking office was roundly and repeatedly mocked by Republicans as a failure . But a majority of economists surveyed by the University of Chicago agree that the stimulus cushioned the blow from the recession . The Federal Reserve also took dramatic action to shore up the sagging economy . And the president 's controversial auto rescue ( along with a bridge loan from the Bush administration ) saved an industry that rebounded to enjoy record sales .\n`` Income gains were actually larger for households at the bottom and the middle [ in 2015 ] than those at the top , '' Obama notes . `` We 've actually begun the long task of reversing inequality . ''\nThat could change , however , in a Trump administration . The president-elect has promised a tax overhaul that would give the biggest tax breaks to those at the top of the income ladder . He 's also likely to unwind an Obama administration rule designed to make millions more low-wage workers eligible for overtime pay .\n`` Thanks to the Affordable Care Act , another 20 million American adults know the financial security and peace of mind that comes with health insurance , '' Obama wrote in his letter . `` For the first time ever , more than 90 percent of Americans are insured \u2014 the highest rate ever . ''\nThe president 's signature health care law has expanded insurance coverage and broadened protections for those who were already insured . It has also encouraged changes in the way medical payments are made \u2014 to reward quality rather than quantity of care . And it has coincided with slower growth in insurance premiums for the majority of Americans who get their insurance through an employer .\nBut the law \u2014 which passed with no Republican support seven years ago \u2014 remains deeply controversial . People buying insurance on the government-run exchanges saw premium increases averaging 25 percent this year . And Republicans have vowed to make repeal of Obamacare their first order of business as soon as they control both Congress and the White House , which they will now .\n`` We 've drawn down from nearly 180,000 troops in harm 's way in Iraq and Afghanistan to just 15,000 , '' Obama wrote .\nObama first ran for the White House determined to end the war in Iraq while refocusing attention on Afghanistan . He ordered the successful special operations raid that killed Osama bin Laden . But an early troop surge in Afghanistan had only limited success in taming the Taliban . While the number of American troops in harm 's way has since been greatly reduced , Obama had to backtrack on plans to withdraw from Afghanistan altogether . And critics say the precipitous American troop withdrawal from Iraq left a vacuum there which gave way to the rise of the Islamic State . In 2014 , Obama was forced to send some troops back to Iraq to address the threat from ISIS .\nObama has steadfastly resisted large-scale intervention in Syria 's civil war . Although the U.S. is the largest contributor of humanitarian relief , a wave of refugees from Syria has had a destabilizing effect throughout Europe . It 's possible that Obama 's abrupt decision in 2013 not to enforce his own `` red line '' against chemical weapons emboldened Syrian President Bashar Assad , as well his Russian sponsor Vladimir Putin , who illegally annexed Crimea the following year .\n`` Over the past eight years , no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland , '' Obama wrote .\nSustained pressure on al-Qaida and ISIS , along with diligent counterterrorism efforts , have prevented another spectacular , Sept. 11-style attack . But as Obama himself has acknowledged , it does n't take much planning or sophistication for violent extremists to bring about carnage . It was shortly after a deadly , ISIS-inspired attack in San Bernardino that Donald Trump called for a ban on foreign Muslims entering the country . That proposal later morphed into `` extreme vetting . ''\nBut the country has proved vulnerable to `` lone wolves '' inspired online by extremists . It has seen those attacks and has had difficulty addressing the problem .\n`` Through diplomacy , we shut down Iran 's nuclear weapons program [ and ] opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba , '' Obama wrote . `` Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago . ''\nThe Iran nuclear deal , which grants Iran sanctions relief in exchange for strict limits and monitoring of its nuclear program , is one of the signature diplomatic achievements of the Obama administration \u2014 the result of painstaking negotiation involving half a dozen allies and adversaries . The deal remains controversial in this country and in Israel . Trump campaigned against it , but top scientists have urged him not to unravel it , saying the agreement has `` dramatically reduced the risk '' of Iran quickly developing a nuclear weapon .\nObama 's diplomatic thaw with Cuba also broke new ground , ending more than half a century of official isolation . Cuba has been slow to match the U.S. in liberalizing trade and travel restrictions . But the White House says its overture to Cuba has also helped improve relations with the rest of the Western hemisphere .\nAmerica 's image in Europe and Asia has generally improved during Obama 's time in office , but it has suffered recently in Israel and the Middle East . Administration efforts to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians went nowhere . And the sweeping trade deal at the heart of Obama 's push to raise America 's profile in the Pacific stalled amid political opposition here at home .\n`` Our dependence on foreign oil has been cut by more than half and our production of renewable energy has more than doubled . In many places across the country , clean energy from the wind is now cheaper than dirtier sources of energy and solar now employs more Americans than coal mining in jobs that pay better than average and ca n't be outsourced . ''\nDomestic oil and natural gas production have surged on Obama 's watch , largely as a result of the fracking revolution . In 2015 , the U.S. relied on imported oil for less than a quarter of its total petroleum needs , the lowest level since 1970 . Wind and solar power have seen rapid growth during the past eight years , though they still account for less than 6 percent of overall electricity generation . Coal and natural gas account for about 33 percent each , while nuclear power contributes about 20 percent .\nPresident Obama led an international effort to cut carbon pollution , resulting in the successful Paris Climate Agreement . But U.S. participation in that deal could be jeopardized by the incoming administration . Trump has tapped Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt , a climate skeptic with strong ties to the fossil-fuel industry , to head the Environmental Protection Administration . Trump and Pruitt have both criticized the power-plant rules at the center of Obama 's climate efforts .\nObama also imposed more stringent energy efficiency standards for cars and appliances , though those could be relaxed by the incoming administration .\n`` The high school graduation rate is now 83 percent \u2014 the highest on record \u2014 and we 've helped more young people graduate from college than ever before . ''\nObama boosted Pell Grants and made it easier for many college graduates to repay student loans . But the cost of a college education continues to rise faster than inflation .\nObama was unable to sell Congress on his idea of universal preschool for low- and middle-income 4-year-olds , although preschool offerings have expanded at the state level . Long-term achievement gaps between white and minority students persist .\nObama also controversially , through stimulus funds , instituted the Common Core standards . His Education Department dangled millions of dollars to states to adopt more rigorous testing and teacher standards , which put a lot of pressure \u2014 and introduced a lot of confusion \u2014 into the system . Despite Common Core being developed by Republican governors , it became a target for Tea Party conservatives and pro-union liberals . Proponents will argue that it introduced data-based accountability on teachers , though teachers , especially those teaching the most difficult populations , would argue they were n't always given the supports they needed .\nObama also controversially expanded charter schools , and the book is still out on their success . Obama also changed the conversation on higher education with a focus on community colleges that had n't been seen before . Scott Jaschik of Insider Higher Ed told PBS NewsHour that even though Obama did n't get free tuition for community colleges , `` Eight years ago , people were not talking about the idea of free college . Now they are . ''\n`` We 've also worked to make the changing face of America more fair and more just ... repealing Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell , and advancing the cause of civil rights , women 's rights , and LGBT rights . ''\nWith help from Congress and the Pentagon , gay and lesbian members of the military can now serve openly , and their spouses receive equal benefits . The Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states in 2015 . And the first bill signed into law by Obama made it easier for women to sue their employers for unequal pay . But a push last year by the Justice and Education Departments to protect the rights of transgender students was halted by a federal judge .\nIn addition to protecting vast tracts of land and water as national monuments , Obama has also used his power to protect smaller parcels , commemorating Harriet Tubman , Cesar Chavez and the Stonewall Inn , where the modern gay-rights movement began .\n`` For all that we 've achieved , there 's still so much I wish we 'd been able to do , from enacting gun safety measures to protect more of our kids and our cops from mass shootings like Newtown , to passing commonsense immigration reform that encourages the best and brightest from around the world to study , stay , and create jobs in America . ''\nImmigration reform and gun-safety legislation were two of the president 's priorities in 2013 , after he won re-election . Gun-safety legislation to expand background checks stalled in the Senate . The Senate did pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul , but it never got a vote in the House . Obama did use his executive powers to give young people brought to the country illegally as children a temporary reprieve from deportation .\nObama also failed in his effort to raise the federal minimum wage ( although 18 states and the District of Columbia have done so since 2013 ) . And while the president has used his commutation power to shorten the prison sentences of more than 1,000 nonviolent drug offenders , his push for more comprehensive criminal-justice reform has stalled .\nCongress also blocked Obama 's bid to close the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , although the prison population has been substantially reduced on his watch , from 242 when Obama took office to around 50 today .\nPresident Obama 's personal popularity helped mask a sharp decline in the Democratic Party nationally over the past eight years . Republicans will soon control not only Congress and the White House , but more than two-thirds of state legislative chambers , and 32 out of 50 governor 's offices .\nThe Democrats who follow Obama have a deep hole to dig themselves out of . But the outgoing president has remained upbeat . Shortly after the November election , he reminded reporters that , in 2004 , when he delivered the speech that launched his national political career , Democrats lost the White House and were completely out of power in Washington . Two years later , they won back Congress , and four years later , he was sworn in as president .\n`` The running thread through my career has been the notion that when ordinary people get involved , get engaged , and come together in collective effort , things change for the better , '' Obama said in his weekly radio address over the weekend . `` It 's easy to lose sight of that truth in the day-to-day back-and-forth of Washington and our minute-to-minute news cycles . But remember that America is a story told over a longer time horizon , in fits and starts , punctuated at times by hardship , but ultimately written by generations of citizens who 've somehow worked together , without fanfare , to form a more perfect union .

As Paul Waldman recently wrote in The American Prospect, the 2020 race has a similar feel to 2004, when Democrats settled on the most \u201celectable\u201d candidate \u2013 John Kerry \u2013 who didn\u2019t spark much passion in the base, and who ultimately lost to President George W. Bush.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a new Quinnipiac University poll this week shows Mr. Biden beating President Trump in a head to head matchup by 13 points \u2013 a spread the pollster characterized as \u201clandslide proportions.\u201d The key group in that poll: independents, who broke for Mr. Biden over President Trump 58 to 28 percent.\n\n\n\nWho knows, maybe Mr. Biden should consider skipping the upcoming Democratic debates?\n\n\n\nLet us know what you\u2019re thinking at csmpolitics@csmonitor.com.",

Austria temporarily halted trains from Italy , while many far-right politicians have used the coronavirus to renew their calls , begun in the wake of terrorism threats by ISIS and migration across the Mediterranean , to end passport-free travel between Schengen countries .\nBut some experts caution against the effectiveness of such bans , and say they also fuel fear of people perceived as \u201c foreign , \u201d or \u201c other. \u201d Incidents of racism , from Canada to the U.S. and across Europe , have spiked toward Chinese populations , and the Asian diaspora more generally .\nIn Italy , the far-right has gained space to rail against open borders in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak , says Cecilia Emma Sottilotta , a professor of political science at the American University of Rome . \u201c It is clearly perfect for political leaders like [ Matteo ] Salvini [ of Italy ] or Marine Le Pen [ in France ] or the [ Alternative for Germany party ] who have been arguing about the control of borders and people , \u201d she says . \u201c They are literally jumping on this . \u201d\nRather than cut off connections , democratic communities must work with each other to overcome the virus , says Devi Sridhar , director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University . \u201c Citizens have to feel the government has their best interest at heart .

During the outbreak of SARS , it became one of the worst-hit countries outside of Asia , especially in Toronto , which was slapped with a WHO travel advisory . The country counted 438 suspected cases and 44 deaths .\nThe government drew up a commission that looked at weaknesses in the response , like a lack of preparedness and of information-sharing between local hospitals , provinces , the federal government , and the rest of the globe .

On Sunday, the administration announced a \u201cradical expansion\u201d of testing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well behind the ball in figuring out what is going on,\u201d Ms. Glassman says.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a top-down command and control system,\u201d she adds. \u201cCivil liberties and individual beliefs play a huge role in people\u2019s health-care seeking and their willingness to be led by government or to do what government advises.\u201d\n\nA global question\n\nIn South Korea, for example, officials have sued a religious group for obstructing the surveillance work of health authorities in the city of Daegu, contributing to a mushrooming of coronavirus cases from dozens to more than 4,300 in only two weeks. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in faces public outrage \u2013 including a petition for his impeachment signed by 1.4 million citizens \u2013 for his handling of the crisis. Mr. Moon is blamed in particular for only belatedly imposing an entry ban on foreigners arriving from China\u2019s Hubei Province, while allowing other Chinese travelers to enter South Korea.\n\nIn Italy, where cases spiked to more than 1,800 as of Monday, towns throughout the northern industrial heartland have been quarantined as officials attempt containment. But the aggressive reaction by authorities has raised concerns over restrictions on freedom of movement and basic human rights.\n\nFrancisco Seco/AP A gondolier looks at his smartphone as he waits for clients in Venice, Italy, Feb. 28, 2020. Authorities in Italy decided to re-open schools and museums in some areas less hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak in the country, which has the most cases outside of Asia.\n\nRaffaele Maresca is an instructor at a free fall wind tunnel in Milan. His job is usually frenetic, with between 200 and 400 clients showing up for indoor skydiving simulation daily. But now all appointments have been postponed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of paranoia. It feels like it\u2019s being blown out of proportion,\u201d he says, wondering if he\u2019ll still be able to go to movies, or even the gym. \u201cI feel it affects my freedom, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nCountries\u2019 responses must be vigorous, but not at the risk of violating human rights, says Steven Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab at York University in Toronto, which advises countries on law and policy in the face of transnational health threats.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to pandemics, following human rights principles actually align with scientific principles,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we are trapped in a city that\u2019s being presented as a high risk to the rest of the world, it\u2019s a natural human tendency to try to leave that city ... which then makes it even harder for public health to identify those folks who might get sick and isolate them.\u201d\n\nAs cases have increased in Europe, freedom of movement, one of the foundational pillars of the European Union, has become a central issue. Austria temporarily halted trains from Italy, while many far-right politicians have used the coronavirus to renew their calls, begun in the wake of terrorism threats by ISIS and migration across the Mediterranean, to end passport-free travel between Schengen countries.\n\nBut some experts caution against the effectiveness of such bans, and say they also fuel fear of people perceived as \u201cforeign,\u201d or \u201cother.\u201d Incidents of racism, from Canada to the U.S. and across Europe, have spiked toward Chinese populations, and the Asian diaspora more generally.\n\nIn Italy, the far-right has gained space to rail against open borders in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, says Cecilia Emma Sottilotta, a professor of political science at the American University of Rome. \u201cIt is clearly perfect for political leaders like [Matteo] Salvini [of Italy] or Marine Le Pen [in France] or the [Alternative for Germany party] who have been arguing about the control of borders and people,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are literally jumping on this.\u201d\n\nRather than cut off connections, democratic communities must work with each other to overcome the virus, says Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. \u201cCitizens have to feel the government has their best interest at heart. And if they do come forward and want to report, they will get the best medical care and not forcibly be put into conditions that are against their will.\u201d\n\nDemocracies\u2019 free-flow of information is also central to their response, a key lesson that Canada learned in 2003. During the outbreak of SARS, it became one of the worst-hit countries outside of Asia, especially in Toronto, which was slapped with a WHO travel advisory. The country counted 438 suspected cases and 44 deaths.\n\nThe government drew up a commission that looked at weaknesses in the response, like a lack of preparedness and of information-sharing between local hospitals, provinces, the federal government, and the rest of the globe. Afterward, Canada created a public health agency that is now leading the coronavirus containment effort.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

''\nIn a separate statement , Whitehouse referred to Whitaker as `` an unconfirmed lackey '' who posed a threat to the investigation into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election , led by Justice special counsel Robert Mueller .\nBefore joining the Justice Department last year as chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions , Whitaker was publicly critical of Mueller 's inquiry and once raised the prospect of cutting off funding for the investigation .\n`` Unless the courts intercede , this troubling move creates a plain road map for persistent and deliberate evasion by the executive branch of the Senate 's constitutionally mandated advice and consent , '' Whitehouse said . `` Indeed , this appointment appears planned to accomplish that goal . \u201d\nLast week , separate legal challenges were filed in Maryland and at the Supreme Court .\nVeteran Supreme Court litigator Thomas Goldstein asked the justices Friday to decide whether Whitaker was legally installed as the temporary successor to Sessions , who Trump ousted nearly two weeks ago .\nThe ultimate goal of all three challenges is the same : a federal court ruling declaring that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the legal and constitutional heir to Sessions .\nJustice officials defended Whitaker 's appointment last week , issuing a 20-page opinion asserting that Whitaker \u2019 s standing as a senior department executive \u201c unquestionably \u201d authorized the president to elevate the former Iowa federal prosecutor .\nJustice \u2019 s Office of Legal Counsel based its findings on provisions of the Vacancies Reform Act , which allows for the appointment of a senior staffer who has been in office for at least 90 days .\nBeyond the arguments over Whitaker 's authority , Democrats and some Republicans seized on Whitaker 's criticism of Mueller 's inquiry and called for his recusal from overseeing the investigation .\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh filed his challenge in federal district court in Maryland last week , calling Whitaker 's appointment `` illegal and unconstitutional .

Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, tracks two other court actions, arguing that Whitaker lacks the Senate confirmation required of all Cabinet officials.\n\nThe senators' filing in a District of Columbia federal court contends that President Donald Trump's appointment was unconstitutional.\n\n\"The U.S. Senate has not consented to Mr. Whitaker serving in any office within the federal government, let alone the highest office of the (Justice Department),\" the senators' lawsuit argues. \"Indeed, if allowed to stand, Mr. Whitaker's appointment would create a road map for the evasion of the constitutionally prescribed Senate advice-and-consent role.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, Whitehouse referred to Whitaker as \"an unconfirmed lackey\" who posed a threat to the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, led by Justice special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nBefore joining the Justice Department last year as chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Whitaker was publicly critical of Mueller's inquiry and once raised the prospect of cutting off funding for the investigation.\n\n\"Unless the courts intercede, this troubling move creates a plain road map for persistent and deliberate evasion by the executive branch of the Senate's constitutionally mandated advice and consent,\" Whitehouse said. \"Indeed, this appointment appears planned to accomplish that goal.\u201d\n\nLast week, separate legal challenges were filed in Maryland and at the Supreme Court.\n\nVeteran Supreme Court litigator Thomas Goldstein asked the justices Friday to decide whether Whitaker was legally installed as the temporary successor to Sessions, who Trump ousted nearly two weeks ago.\n\nThe ultimate goal of all three challenges is the same: a federal court ruling declaring that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the legal and constitutional heir to Sessions.\n\nJustice officials defended Whitaker's appointment last week, issuing a 20-page opinion asserting that Whitaker\u2019s standing as a senior department executive \u201cunquestionably\u201d authorized the president to elevate the former Iowa federal prosecutor.\n\nJustice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel based its findings on provisions of the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows for the appointment of a senior staffer who has been in office for at least 90 days.\n\nBeyond the arguments over Whitaker's authority, Democrats and some Republicans seized on Whitaker's criticism of Mueller's inquiry and called for his recusal from overseeing the investigation.\n\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh filed his challenge in federal district court in Maryland last week, calling Whitaker's appointment \"illegal and unconstitutional.\" The case is scheduled to be heard Dec. 19 but could take months before reaching the Supreme Court.\n\nGoldstein's effort is aimed at leapfrogging lower courts and getting the justices to decide who Sessions' replacement should be, perhaps within weeks.\n\nMore:Supreme Court asked to rule on Trump's choice of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general\n\nMore:Matthew Whitaker isn't acting like just a caretaker as interim attorney general\n\nMore:Democrats to investigate Matthew Whitaker's role with company that allegedly bilked customers of millions",

        "content": "Supporters worry about cascading problems as key provisions go into effect .\nUncertainty about the law has risen as time has passed\nFour in 10 Americans do n't believe the law is still in place\nWASHINGTON -- The Affordable Care Act is sure to survive the latest vote by the House of Representatives Thursday to repeal it \u2014 since the Senate does n't plan to take it up and President Obama would veto a repeal bill if it somehow reached his desk \u2014 but the administration 's signature legislative achievement still faces serious perils ahead .\nAmericans have a dimmer view of the health care law now than they did when Obama triumphantly signed it three years ago , according to monthly tracking polls by the Kaiser Family Foundation . The public 's divided view and relentless Republican attacks have made it easier for governors and state legislators to balk at cooperating with the law . It is designed to provide coverage for millions of Americans who have n't qualified for Medicaid in the past and do n't get insurance through their employers .\nThat could have a cascading effect : Resistance by the states will make it harder for the law to work as promised when Medicaid expands next year and the health-insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can shop for plans open this fall .\nThat could fortify the arguments of those who warned the law was a mistake from the start and threaten fundamental provisions of it down the road .\n`` For most of the Obama administration , the thought was the bill was passed and it 's over , '' says Robert Blendon , a Harvard professor and influential analyst who supports the law . The president understandably turned his attention to the fragile economy , and the most far-reaching expansions of coverage were delayed until 2014 \u2014 leaving the door open for opponents to warn of calamity ahead . `` By the time they returned to it , '' Blendon says of White House officials , `` opinions were really embedded . ''\nJust over a third of Americans , 35 % , have a favorable opinion of the health law , according to the Kaiser survey taken last month , down from 46 % who had a positive view when it was signed in 2010 . Now 40 % have an unfavorable opinion \u2014 precisely the same as three years ago \u2014 and nearly one in four , 24 % , say they do n't have an opinion .\nThe poll of 1,203 adults , taken April 15-20 , has a margin of error of +/\u20133 percentage points .\nUncertainty about the law has risen as time has passed , and confusion about what it does and how it works is especially high among those it is designed to help . In fact , four in 10 Americans do n't believe the law is still in place , saying inaccurately that it 's been overturned by the Supreme Court or repealed by Congress .\nStill the law ? As you know , a health care bill was signed into law in March 2010 . What 's its current status ? Poll taken April 15-20 of 1,203 adults . Margin of error +/- 3 percentage points .\n`` People have n't really seen the benefits of it , and it 's had hundreds of millions of dollars in ads attacking it , '' says Neera Tanden , who helped shape the law as Obama adviser and now heads the liberal Center for American Progress . `` One party was definitely consistently criticizing it , and Democrats have not been sufficiently defending it . So it 's been a lopsided argument . ''\nThe White House is scrambling to bolster support for and knowledge about the law , in part to encourage younger and healthier Americans who lack health insurance to shop for a plan when the exchanges open Oct. 1 .

(Photo: Charles Dharapak, AP) Story Highlights Just over a third of Americans, 35%, have a favorable opinion of the health law\n\nUncertainty about the law has risen as time has passed\n\nFour in 10 Americans don't believe the law is still in place\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Affordable Care Act is sure to survive the latest vote by the House of Representatives Thursday to repeal it \u2014 since the Senate doesn't plan to take it up and President Obama would veto a repeal bill if it somehow reached his desk \u2014 but the administration's signature legislative achievement still faces serious perils ahead.\n\nAmericans have a dimmer view of the health care law now than they did when Obama triumphantly signed it three years ago, according to monthly tracking polls by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The public's divided view and relentless Republican attacks have made it easier for governors and state legislators to balk at cooperating with the law. It is designed to provide coverage for millions of Americans who haven't qualified for Medicaid in the past and don't get insurance through their employers.\n\nThat could have a cascading effect: Resistance by the states will make it harder for the law to work as promised when Medicaid expands next year and the health-insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can shop for plans open this fall.\n\nThat could fortify the arguments of those who warned the law was a mistake from the start and threaten fundamental provisions of it down the road.\n\n\"For most of the Obama administration, the thought was the bill was passed and it's over,\" says Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor and influential analyst who supports the law. The president understandably turned his attention to the fragile economy, and the most far-reaching expansions of coverage were delayed until 2014 \u2014 leaving the door open for opponents to warn of calamity ahead. \"By the time they returned to it,\" Blendon says of White House officials, \"opinions were really embedded.\"\n\nJust over a third of Americans, 35%, have a favorable opinion of the health law, according to the Kaiser survey taken last month, down from 46% who had a positive view when it was signed in 2010. Now 40% have an unfavorable opinion \u2014 precisely the same as three years ago \u2014 and nearly one in four, 24%, say they don't have an opinion.\n\nThe poll of 1,203 adults, taken April 15-20, has a margin of error of +/\u20133 percentage points.\n\nUncertainty about the law has risen as time has passed, and confusion about what it does and how it works is especially high among those it is designed to help. In fact, four in 10 Americans don't believe the law is still in place, saying inaccurately that it's been overturned by the Supreme Court or repealed by Congress.\n\nStill the law? As you know, a health care bill was signed into law in March 2010. What's its current status? Poll taken April 15-20 of 1,203 adults. Margin of error +/- 3 percentage points.\n\n\"People haven't really seen the benefits of it, and it's had hundreds of millions of dollars in ads attacking it,\" says Neera Tanden, who helped shape the law as Obama adviser and now heads the liberal Center for American Progress. \"One party was definitely consistently criticizing it, and Democrats have not been sufficiently defending it. So it's been a lopsided argument.\"\n\nThe White House is scrambling to bolster support for and knowledge about the law, in part to encourage younger and healthier Americans who lack health insurance to shop for a plan when the exchanges open Oct. 1. Officials are trying to spotlight popular policies that already have gone into effect, including provisions that provide free preventive care for seniors and allow young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plans.\n\nThey also are trying to reassure skeptical employers about the law and its provisions. In a Gallup Poll last month, owners of small businesses predicted by 5-1, 48%-9%, that the Affordable Care Act was going to be bad rather than good for their businesses. About four in 10 said they had held off plans to hire new workers and pulled back on plans to grow their businesses because of the law and its mandates.\n\n\"The law is here to stay,\" Obama declared at an East Room event last week \u2014 not an assertion presidents typically feel compelled to make. He noted that not only did Congress pass the law in 2010 (albeit without a single Republican vote) but also the Supreme Court upheld it last year.

It's not an easy undertaking, but if it were easy, it would have already been done a long time ago. Undoubtedly, there will be some mistakes and hiccups as the thing get started up, but we're learning already from them.\"\n\nREMEMBERING TOWN HALLS\n\nAmong those most anxious and nervous about possible \"mistakes and hiccups\" ahead are Democratic members of Congress who voted for the law.\n\nOpposition to Obamacare fueled the rise of the Tea Party and the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 congressional elections. \"Those of us who remember 2009 and the town-hall meetings, we want to be fully prepared now,\" says Rep.

        "content": "A conservative think tank estimated Monday that granting citizenship to 11 million people in the U.S. illegally would cost taxpayers trillions of dollars , a conclusion that split the Republican Party and added a new level of complexity to efforts in the Senate to overhaul immigration laws .\nThe analysis from the Heritage Foundation concluded that the net cost would be at least $ 6.3 trillion in inflation-adjusted terms as immigrants gaining legal status would receive $ 9.4 trillion in government benefits and services over their lifetimes while paying $ 3.1 trillion in taxes .\nThe Senate bill would `` take a really bad , broken system and make it much more expensive and much worse from the taxpayer 's perspective , '' said Robert Rector , a senior research fellow at Heritage and the report 's lead author . In contrast , he said , the more-limited benefits illegal immigrants now receive carry a tab of about $ 1 trillion over their lifetimes .\n`` It 's a big deal , '' said Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions , a Republican skeptic of immigration changes . `` It 's a dramatic finding that clearly makes it more difficult for the sponsors to win support . ''\nIn contrast , former Mississippi Gov . Haley Barbour , also a Republican , called it a `` political document '' that `` is designed to try to scare conservative Republicans into thinking the cost here is going to be so gigantic that you ca n't possibly be for it . '' He and other supporters of the Senate bill believe it would boost economic growth and help cut the deficit over the long haul .\nThe rift among Republicans , and the broader debate over the immigration proposal , is sure to persist this week as the Senate Judiciary Committee begins considering the legislation , which was crafted by a bipartisan group of eight senators .\nHeritage , which is skeptical of an immigration overhaul , released a similar report in 2007 that many in the GOP believe helped derail an effort to rewrite immigration laws at the time .\nThe Heritage report tallied the fiscal impact of changes to immigration law , according to a summary , but did n't assess the impact of any macroeconomic benefits , also known as `` dynamic '' scoring , which Republicans have long preferred . That approach would assess changes to worker and employer behavior , and to the broader economy , that could result from new immigration laws .\n`` By ignoring that the economy will be a lot bigger and more productive as a result of immigration , they massively undercounted the benefits of immigration reform , '' said Alex Nowrasteh , immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute .\nSen. Sherrod Brown ( D. , Ohio ) also disagreed with the study : `` Immigration creates wealth\u2014it 's not that it 's a cost . It 's clear over time that it 's new energy that creates jobs and wealth and businesses . ''\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which will calculate the bill 's official cost if it survives a committee vote , said last week that it would include a supplemental study gauging the economic impact . When the CBO did that for a failed immigration push during the Bush administration , it found the bill could have helped reduce the deficit by as much as $ 160 billion over 10 years . A separate CBO analysis that did n't take into account all economic benefits concluded an unsuccessful bill would have added $ 18 billion to the deficit over a decade .\nThe CBO usually limits its estimate of a bill 's costs to a decade . But with major legislation , such as the immigration proposal , it can offer longer estimates . The Heritage calculation used a 50-year horizon for the estimated remaining life span of the typical unauthorized immigrant already living as an adult in the U.S .\n`` A number of people in Congress do not want to consider the cost , '' said Jim DeMint , the Heritage president and a former Republican senator from South Carolina . `` They play their normal tricks of trying to push some of the expenses outside the 10-year window . ''\nUnder the proposed Senate plan , most unauthorized immigrants would n't be eligible for government benefits for at least a decade . During that time , their tax payments would total more than any benefits they receive , according to the Heritage report . It estimated the brunt of the bill 's cost would come once they became eligible for programs such as welfare and food stamps , and eventually for Social Security and Medicare . The Heritage study also assessed the cost of immigrants using parks , roads and courts and the cost of educating their children .\nOn average , a household of currently unauthorized immigrants would receive $ 592,000 more in government benefits than it paid in taxes over the course of a lifetime , the report estimated . Mr. Rector 's conclusions are based on the assessment that a large share of immigrant households are headed by people with low levels of education , who have lower incomes and are likely to use government-benefits programs .",

Jeff Sessions, a Republican skeptic of immigration changes. \"It's a dramatic finding that clearly makes it more difficult for the sponsors to win support.\"\n\nIn contrast, former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, also a Republican, called it a \"political document\" that \"is designed to try to scare conservative Republicans into thinking the cost here is going to be so gigantic that you can't possibly be for it.\" He and other supporters of the Senate bill believe it would boost economic growth and help cut the deficit over the long haul.\n\nThe rift among Republicans, and the broader debate over the immigration proposal, is sure to persist this week as the Senate Judiciary Committee begins considering the legislation, which was crafted by a bipartisan group of eight senators.\n\nHeritage, which is skeptical of an immigration overhaul, released a similar report in 2007 that many in the GOP believe helped derail an effort to rewrite immigration laws at the time.\n\nA push to overhaul the immigration system would cost U.S. taxpayers at least $6.3 trillion according to a Heritage Foundation report. Plus, what's stopping the U.S. from getting involved in the Syria conflict? Photo: Associated Press.\n\nThe Heritage report tallied the fiscal impact of changes to immigration law, according to a summary, but didn't assess the impact of any macroeconomic benefits, also known as \"dynamic\" scoring, which Republicans have long preferred. That approach would assess changes to worker and employer behavior, and to the broader economy, that could result from new immigration laws.\n\n\"By ignoring that the economy will be a lot bigger and more productive as a result of immigration, they massively undercounted the benefits of immigration reform,\" said Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) also disagreed with the study: \"Immigration creates wealth\u2014it's not that it's a cost. It's clear over time that it's new energy that creates jobs and wealth and businesses.\"\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which will calculate the bill's official cost if it survives a committee vote, said last week that it would include a supplemental study gauging the economic impact. When the CBO did that for a failed immigration push during the Bush administration, it found the bill could have helped reduce the deficit by as much as $160 billion over 10 years. A separate CBO analysis that didn't take into account all economic benefits concluded an unsuccessful bill would have added $18 billion to the deficit over a decade.\n\nThe CBO usually limits its estimate of a bill's costs to a decade. But with major legislation, such as the immigration proposal, it can offer longer estimates. The Heritage calculation used a 50-year horizon for the estimated remaining life span of the typical unauthorized immigrant already living as an adult in the U.S.\n\n\"A number of people in Congress do not want to consider the cost,\" said Jim DeMint, the Heritage president and a former Republican senator from South Carolina. \"They play their normal tricks of trying to push some of the expenses outside the 10-year window.\"\n\nUnder the proposed Senate plan, most unauthorized immigrants wouldn't be eligible for government benefits for at least a decade. During that time, their tax payments would total more than any benefits they receive, according to the Heritage report. It estimated the brunt of the bill's cost would come once they became eligible for programs such as welfare and food stamps, and eventually for Social Security and Medicare. The Heritage study also assessed the cost of immigrants using parks, roads and courts and the cost of educating their children.\n\nOn average, a household of currently unauthorized immigrants would receive $592,000 more in government benefits than it paid in taxes over the course of a lifetime, the report estimated. Mr. Rector's conclusions are based on the assessment that a large share of immigrant households are headed by people with low levels of education, who have lower incomes and are likely to use government-benefits programs.\n\n\u2014Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Sara Murray at sara.murray@wsj.com",

The policy\u2019s challengers also point to views he has expressed as president, including his retweets in November of anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British political figure.\n\nIn a court filing last week, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, representing Trump in court, said those retweets \u201cdo not address the meaning\u201d of the travel ban policy.\n\nFrancisco cited Trump statements complimentary toward Muslims and Islam, including in a May 2017 speech in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn defending the ban, the administration has pointed to a waiver provision allowing people from targeted countries to seek entry if they meet certain criteria. The State Department said that as of last month 375 waivers to the travel ban had been granted since the policy went into effect on Dec 8.\n\nSome former Republican senators and officials who served in Republican former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration have signed onto legal briefs asking the high court to invalidate the ban.\n\n\u201cI think the travel ban is a terribly misguided policy that appeared to be motivated more by a political intention of the president than by any real national security need,\u201d John Bellinger, the State Department\u2019s top legal advisor during the Bush administration, said in an interview.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A view of the U.S. Supreme Court building is seen in Washington, DC, U.S., October 13, 2015. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nThe arguments in the case follow U.S. missile strikes this month in one of the targeted countries, Syria, after Trump\u2019s administration blamed President Bashar al-Assad for a chemical weapons attack on Syrian people near Damascus.\n\n\u201cLots of people have pointed out the hypocrisy of the president on the one hand being willing to bomb Syria and on the other hand being unwilling to accept refugees and immigrants from that country who are trying to escape,\u201d lawyer Omar Jadwat of the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the travel ban in a separate case in Maryland, said in an interview.\n\nVenezuela and North Korea also were targeted in the travel ban but those restrictions were not challenged in court.",

For candidates , they can be tripping hazards best avoided . It \u2019 s easy to make a foreign-policy gaffe \u2013 mispronouncing a foreign leader \u2019 s name , say , or placing their nation on the wrong continent . But it \u2019 s hard to get a campaign rally excited by calls to \u201c support the liberal international order . \u201d\nStill , 2020 could be different . Mr. Trump \u2019 s disruptive approach to foreign policy , from his threats to Iran to his denigration of longtime NATO allies , may indeed have made some voters wary .

        "date": "2017-02-13",
        "authors": "Linda Feldmann",
        "content": "President Trump \u2019 s national security adviser , Mike Flynn , is out . He resigned under fire late Monday night , amid controversy over conversations he had with the Russian ambassador before Mr. Trump \u2019 s inauguration \u2013 conversations he then misrepresented to top White House officials , including Vice President Pence .\nGeneral Flynn \u2019 s departure caps a tumultuous episode , extraordinary for an administration not even one month in office . But the situation with Flynn isn \u2019 t the only personnel matter afoot .\nThere \u2019 s also buzz that White House press secretary Sean Spicer may be in trouble , and questions , too , about the performance of chief of staff Reince Priebus . The Flynn story is much bigger than the other two , but the sum total is the appearance of a White House in turmoil , and a president new to government struggling to find his balance .\nSo here \u2019 s the question : How much of the early ferment at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue stems directly from Trump himself \u2013 in both his management style and his lack of government experience \u2013 and how much is the typical settling-in that any new administration experiences ? The answer may be , all of the above .\n\u201c The turmoil is not normal , \u201d says Cal Jillson , a presidential scholar at Southern Methodist University in Dallas . \u201c It is true that every new administration has a shakedown period\u2026 . But we \u2019 ve never seen it in quite such an early and tumultuous way . \u201d\nPresident Obama \u2019 s first national security adviser , James Jones , lasted less than nine months , and his first communications director , Ellen Moran , only three months . As happens in any enterprise , some new hires just don \u2019 t work out .\nBut with Trump , there are complicating factors to layer on . His is an insurgent presidency , whose stated goal is to shake things up . And so he may be less inclined to listen to voices of experience in his effort to disrupt the status quo . In addition , Trump \u2019 s management style is to bring competing power centers into his midst , as a way to surface new and creative ideas , say people who have studied his business practices .\nStill , it \u2019 s one thing to operate that way in a privately held corporation , and another to bring that style into the White House . Trump the executive has a history of being mercurial , according to people who have studied his management style .\n\u201c Rather than magisterial and decisive , Trump the actual boss swings wildly between micromanaging meddler and can \u2019 t-be-bothered , broad-brush , big-picture thinker , \u201d writes Michael Kruse in a Politico profile of Trump last summer .\n\u201c He is both impulsive and intuitive , for better and for worse . He hires on gut instinct rather than qualifications ; he listens to others , but not as much or as often as he listens to himself , \u201d Mr. Kruse writes .\nThe story of Flynn , who had been fired by the Obama administration as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency , may be a case in point . While at DIA , Flynn reportedly made enemies with his bosses at the Pentagon and with a rival spy service , the Central Intelligence Agency , according to NPR .\nFlynn \u2019 s clashes with Obama administration officials may have been a plus for Trump , and chalked up to politics , not a sign of a potentially troublesome employee .\nIn recent days , Flynn faced a flood of questions over contact he had with the Russian ambassador to the US , Sergey Kislyak , before Trump took office .

        "content_original": "President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Flynn, is out. He resigned under fire late Monday night, amid controversy over conversations he had with the Russian ambassador before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2013 conversations he then misrepresented to top White House officials, including Vice President Pence.\n\nGeneral Flynn\u2019s departure caps a tumultuous episode, extraordinary for an administration not even one month in office. But the situation with Flynn isn\u2019t the only personnel matter afoot.\n\nThere\u2019s also buzz that White House press secretary Sean Spicer may be in trouble, and questions, too, about the performance of chief of staff Reince Priebus. The Flynn story is much bigger than the other two, but the sum total is the appearance of a White House in turmoil, and a president new to government struggling to find his balance.\n\nSo here\u2019s the question: How much of the early ferment at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue stems directly from Trump himself \u2013 in both his management style and his lack of government experience \u2013 and how much is the typical settling-in that any new administration experiences? The answer may be, all of the above.\n\n\u201cThe turmoil is not normal,\u201d says Cal Jillson, a presidential scholar at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cIt is true that every new administration has a shakedown period\u2026. But we\u2019ve never seen it in quite such an early and tumultuous way.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s first national security adviser, James Jones, lasted less than nine months, and his first communications director, Ellen Moran, only three months. As happens in any enterprise, some new hires just don\u2019t work out.\n\nInsurgent management\n\nBut with Trump, there are complicating factors to layer on. His is an insurgent presidency, whose stated goal is to shake things up. And so he may be less inclined to listen to voices of experience in his effort to disrupt the status quo. In addition, Trump\u2019s management style is to bring competing power centers into his midst, as a way to surface new and creative ideas, say people who have studied his business practices.\n\nStill, it\u2019s one thing to operate that way in a privately held corporation, and another to bring that style into the White House. Trump the executive has a history of being mercurial, according to people who have studied his management style.\n\n\u201cRather than magisterial and decisive, Trump the actual boss swings wildly between micromanaging meddler and can\u2019t-be-bothered, broad-brush, big-picture thinker,\u201d writes Michael Kruse in a Politico profile of Trump last summer.\n\n\u201cHe is both impulsive and intuitive, for better and for worse. He hires on gut instinct rather than qualifications; he listens to others, but not as much or as often as he listens to himself,\u201d Mr. Kruse writes.\n\nThe story of Flynn, who had been fired by the Obama administration as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, may be a case in point. While at DIA, Flynn reportedly made enemies with his bosses at the Pentagon and with a rival spy service, the Central Intelligence Agency, according to NPR .\n\nFlynn\u2019s clashes with Obama administration officials may have been a plus for Trump, and chalked up to politics, not a sign of a potentially troublesome employee.\n\nIn recent days, Flynn faced a flood of questions over contact he had with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, before Trump took office. In conversations with Mr. Pence and other senior administration officials, Flynn initially denied discussing US sanctions against Russia with Ambassador Kislyak, then said later that he may have.\n\nDid Flynn mislead?\n\nSuch a discussion on sanctions may violate a US law that bars private citizens from interfering in foreign policy. But the immediate issue was whether Flynn misled top-level US officials. An obvious trouble sign yet for Flynn\u2019s employment prospects came Sunday, when senior White House aide Stephen Miller declined to say that Flynn still had Trump\u2019s confidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to tell you what\u2019s in the president\u2019s mind,\u201d Mr. Miller said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, top administration officials put out mixed messages. After Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters the president still had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Flynn, Spicer put out a statement saying the president was \u201cevaluating the situation.\u201d\n\nBy Monday night, Flynn\u2019s prospects grew even worse. The Washington Post published a story saying that in late January, the acting attorney general had informed the Trump White House about Flynn\u2019s contact with the Russian ambassador, and warned that Flynn was \u201cpotentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail.\u201d\n\nIn his resignation statement, Flynn acknowledged that he had misled his colleagues, but said he did not do so intentionally.\n\n\"I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology,\" Flynn wrote.\n\nSpicer may also be in trouble\n\nPerhaps the second-most-endangered member of Trump\u2019s corps of top advisers is Spicer, the press secretary. His debut in the press room quickly became the stuff of legend, when he stepped out in an ill-fitting suit and reamed out the press without taking questions, reportedly leaving Trump less than satisfied.\n\nSpicer has since settled into a routine with his daily briefing, calling on a range of reporters \u2013 including many from conservative media \u2013 and sticking less to the usual mainstream outlets.\n\nSpicer still mixes it up with reporters who push back and try to ask follow-ups.

Over the weekend on CNN , Trump friend Christopher Ruddy, CEO of conservative Newsmax Media, knocked Priebus\u2019s performance, saying \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of weakness coming out of the chief of staff.\u201d\n\nMr. Ruddy later pulled back on his negative assessment.

        "content": "It was only a few months ago that someone last treated Cassie Johns like a freak .\nDuring a doctor \u2019 s office visit in February , she was asked to list her emergency contacts . Johns , a preschool teacher in Seattle , wrote down two people -- Chris and Joan -- and identified both as her \u201c partners. \u201d They are two of the four romantic interests Johns has been involved with for many years .\n\u201c \u2018 Oh , that \u2019 s so dirty , \u2019 \u201d Johns recalled the receptionist saying . \u201c And the receptionist literally stepped back from me , in a doctor \u2019 s office . \u201d\nJohns , 58 , is a polyamorist . She follows a non-monogamous lifestyle in which multiple partners give each other consent to date and have sex with others . Johns \u2019 s longest polyamorous relationship has lasted 36 years , twice as long as her former marriage to a polyamorous man . She talks openly about her partners to her preschool students and others .\n\u201c I have lost jobs , I \u2019 ve lost an apartment , I \u2019 ve lost a car loan , \u201d because of her lifestyle , Johns said . \u201c I \u2019 ve lost friendly relations with neighbors . \u201d\nDespite the acceptance of campus hook-up culture and Tinder-arranged trysts , more intentional forms of consensual non-monogamy \u2013 which can include polygamy , polyamory , open marriages , group marriages , swinging and \u201c relationship anarchy \u201d \u2013 are highly stigmatized . Such behavior is widely considered to be abusive , immoral , or emotionally stunted . People in such relationships not only face rudeness and public shaming , they also lack legal protections against discrimination in employment , housing and child custody disputes .\nPolyamorists distinguish their lifestyle from cheating and adultery because , they say , it hinges on the consent of all parties , and can involve unmarried people . Activists say such behavior is more common than many people presume . Some studies suggest that as many as a fifth of Americans have engaged in consensual non-monogamy at some point in their lives . The studies show that at any given time , an estimated 4 % to 5 % of the population is in a consensually non-monogamous relationship .\nKatie Hill in a pro-equality appearance in California -- before her fledgling congressional career was brought up short by allegations of being involved in a \u201c throuple \u201d including a staffer .\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing are expected to put a temporary damper on polyamory , those numbers could rise if the social disincentives were removed \u2013 in part because some adulterers and cheaters could become consensual non-monogamists .\nActivists are moving to dismantle the legal and social barriers , and say their goals are beginning to take shape .\nThey are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people , gays , lesbians , women and blacks . Not too long ago , those marginalized groups were also viewed as unnatural , depraved or inferior , until negative judgments became socially unacceptable and often illegal .\nThe aspirations of non-monogamists don \u2019 t sound like such a moonshot in an increasingly tolerant society where a transgender man can menstruate and experience childbirth , and Pete Buttigieg , a gay man married to another man , can make a serious run for U.S. president .\nAs the topic breaks into the mainstream , some churches are beginning to grapple with the issue , and polyamorous students are forming university clubs and organizing events . Last fall polyamory got attention , some of it sympathetic , when California Rep. Katie Hill , was forced to resign over allegations she was having an affair with a campaign staffer in a \u201c throuple \u201d with her then-husband . A recent TV episode of \u201c House Hunters '' featured three adults searching for a home to build their polyamorous nest , and Hollywood celebrities are opening up about their polyamorous lifestyles as well .\nLifestyle personality Aubrey Marcus says he has been in an open relationship with his fiance Whitney Miller since 2013 . He gives advice on ethical non-monogamy on his website .\n\u201c There is plenty of evidence that consensual non-monogamy is an emerging civil rights movement , \u201d said Heath Schechinger , a counseling psychologist at the University of California , Berkeley , and co-chair of the Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force , recently created within the American Psychological Association . \u201c I 've heard from a number of people advocating for relationship structure diversity over the past 20 years who are elated about this issue finally gaining traction . \u201d\nActivists are already working with elected officials in more than a dozen local governments , especially in California , to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class , \u201c relationship structure , \u201d said Berkeley psychologist and poly activist Dave Doleshal .\nMost efforts are at the informal stage but the city of Berkeley did consider a formal proposal to extend protections in housing , employment , business practices , city facilities or education to swingers , polyamorists and other non-monogamists . The proposal stalled last year amid concerns that it would have required employers to provide health insurance to numerous sexual and romantic partners outside of marriage .\nPro-polyamory marchers in San Francisco in 2004 . Especially in California , there are moves afoot to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class : \u201c relationship structure . \u201d\nUndaunted by that setback , advocates continue to generate a body of ideas and theories that normalize non-monogamy as a form of positive sexuality -- and possibly an identity -- following a script followed by other marginalized groups . Their efforts have led to reassessments of non-monogamy in the psychological and legal fields , contending the relationships are emotionally healthy and ethical , and thus forging a social movement with a shared identity , shared vocabulary , shared history and a shared desire for full recognition .\nOver the past two decades , nearly 600 academic papers have been written on the subject of non-monogamy , according to one count , including an assessment of the benefits to children in polyamorous families . Such research creates a body of scholarship to counteract ingrained social attitudes that poly advocates call prejudices and misconceptions . At the same time , the field has spawned more than 50 books , mostly written by women , said Kenneth Haslam , 85 , a retired anesthesiologist and polyamorist in Durham , N.C. , who helped create the polyamory history archive at the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington , Ind .\nBrian Watson , author of \u201c Annals of Pornographie : How Porn Became \u2018 Bad \u2019 \u201d ( 2016 ) , is co-authoring a book on non-monogamy throughout history . He said it will feature 50 to 100 prominent figures , such as Victor Hugo and Virginia Woolf , and is deliberately modeled on earlier works about famous gay people .\nJust as women \u2019 s rights grew from feminist legal theory and LGBTQ rights from queer theory , non-monogamy is also developing its own historiography , scholarship and theoretical frameworks .\nThe polyamory flag . Advocates are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people , gays , lesbians , women and blacks .\nStill , it 's not easy to pinpoint a polyamorist profile . They are less likely to identify as heterosexual or to conform to gender norms , but academic studies and anecdotal evidence do n't tell a single story . While some non-monogamists consider themselves neo-pagans , anarchists or socialists , others are libertarians or outwardly conventional suburbanites . Some studies say the lifestyle attracts more men , others say more women ; some say it appeals to affluent whites , others say a polyamorist 's average annual income is under $ 40,000 .\nIn the legal arena , sympathetic scholars are arguing for the extension of legal reforms adopted in family law in recent decades in response to the continued erosion of the nuclear family , which is no longer America \u2019 s dominant family structure .\nAt least a dozen states now recognize or allow for the possibility of a child having more than two parents , an accommodation for surrogate parents , grandparents , stepparents and other nontraditional families , according to a February legal article by Edward Stein , a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York .\nThese expansions of the legal concept of family are potential pathways for non-monogamous families to win legal rights of their own , Stein said . Another potential legal opening could be the existing precedents in domestic partnerships and civil unions that were set up locally for gays and lesbians before same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 . In both cases , legal victories for one group could be extended to another group , a common way that legal developments happen , he said .\nThe first steps would likely have to be decriminalizing of adultery in the 38 states that don \u2019 t distinguish between consensual and non-consensual non-monogamy . The prohibition of adultery is comparable to anti-sodomy laws whose repeal by the Supreme Court in 2003 cleared an obstacle for recognizing gay marriage , Stein said .\nThe 1961 science fiction classic often cited as an inspiration by non-monogamists .\n\u201c I think what we will see is a lot of chipping away at the edges of some of the restrictions we put on what a family is and what a family does , \u201d said Janet W. Hardy , who has written on polyamory for more than 20 years . \u201c When the legal challenge comes \u2013 and it will \u2013 I don \u2019 t think it will be from people who identify themselves as poly . I think it will come from blended families and some of the other ways that we are reforming around the idea of family that are legally challenging . \u201d\nOne such example was a recent effort by Hartford , Conn. , authorities to evict eight adults and three children living as a single family in a 6,000-square-foot mansion .\nThe combined family was not polyamorous , said their lawyer , Peter Goselin , but shared financial , domestic and child-rearing responsibilities . In 2014 the city alleged a violation of its zoning rules for single-family homes , but after two years of litigation , the city dropped its case .\nThe joint owners and residents of the home claimed a constitutional right to define a family . The octet \u2019 s lawsuit against the city includes a brief history of communal family living , from Iroquois longhouses , which housed up to 20 family units , to the communes , cooperatives and collective households of the 19th and 20th centuries .\n\u201c They saw the implications of it , \u201d Goselin said . \u201c Privately they said to me we know this would be encouraging to a lot of people who are in polyamorous relationships . \u201d\nAdvocates say that the warnings against the perils of non-monogamy echo the now-debunked concerns about same-sex marriage .\n\u201c All of the well-known objections made against multi-person intimate relationships can be made against same- or opposite-sex monogamy as well , resulting in an indefensible double standard , \u201d Ronald C. Den Otter , a political science professor at California Polytechnic Institute wrote in a 2015 article in the Emory Law Review . \u201c Sadly , many two-person intimate relationships are dysfunctional , and a closer , more brutally honest look at them should not inspire confidence in their superiority . \u201d\nOnce changes get under way , things can move quickly . The rise of the modern gay rights movement in the mid-20th century led to a decision by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973 to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders ( gender dysphoria was de-pathologized in 2012 ) .

Johns, a preschool teacher in Seattle, wrote down two people -- Chris and Joan -- and identified both as her \u201cpartners.\u201d They are two of the four romantic interests Johns has been involved with for many years.\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, that\u2019s so dirty,\u2019\u201d Johns recalled the receptionist saying. \u201cAnd the receptionist literally stepped back from me, in a doctor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nThe parrot symbol of polyamory, or relationships in which multiple partners give each other consent to date and have sex with others. Top photo: Scene from a recent TV episode of \u201cHouse Hunters\" featuring three adults searching for a home to build their polyamorous nest.\n\nJohns, 58, is a polyamorist. She follows a non-monogamous lifestyle in which multiple partners give each other consent to date and have sex with others. Johns\u2019s longest polyamorous relationship has lasted 36 years, twice as long as her former marriage to a polyamorous man. She talks openly about her partners to her preschool students and others.\n\nBut her forthrightness has a price.\n\n\u201cI have lost jobs, I\u2019ve lost an apartment, I\u2019ve lost a car loan,\u201d because of her lifestyle, Johns said. \u201cI\u2019ve lost friendly relations with neighbors.\u201d\n\nDespite the acceptance of campus hook-up culture and Tinder-arranged trysts, more intentional forms of consensual non-monogamy \u2013 which can include polygamy, polyamory, open marriages, group marriages, swinging and \u201crelationship anarchy\u201d \u2013 are highly stigmatized. Such behavior is widely considered to be abusive, immoral, or emotionally stunted. People in such relationships not only face rudeness and public shaming, they also lack legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing and child custody disputes.\n\nPolyamorists distinguish their lifestyle from cheating and adultery because, they say, it hinges on the consent of all parties, and can involve unmarried people. Activists say such behavior is more common than many people presume. Some studies suggest that as many as a fifth of Americans have engaged in consensual non-monogamy at some point in their lives. The studies show that at any given time, an estimated 4% to 5% of the population is in a consensually non-monogamous relationship.\n\nKatie Hill in a pro-equality appearance in California -- before her fledgling congressional career was brought up short by allegations of being involved in a \u201cthrouple\u201d including a staffer.\n\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing are expected to put a temporary damper on polyamory, those numbers could rise if the social disincentives were removed \u2013 in part because some adulterers and cheaters could become consensual non-monogamists.\n\nActivists are moving to dismantle the legal and social barriers, and say their goals are beginning to take shape.\n\nThey are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people, gays, lesbians, women and blacks. Not too long ago, those marginalized groups were also viewed as unnatural, depraved or inferior, until negative judgments became socially unacceptable and often illegal.\n\nThe aspirations of non-monogamists don\u2019t sound like such a moonshot in an increasingly tolerant society where a transgender man can menstruate and experience childbirth, and Pete Buttigieg, a gay man married to another man, can make a serious run for U.S. president.\n\nAs the topic breaks into the mainstream, some churches are beginning to grapple with the issue, and polyamorous students are forming university clubs and organizing events. Last fall polyamory got attention, some of it sympathetic, when California Rep. Katie Hill, was forced to resign over allegations she was having an affair with a campaign staffer in a \u201cthrouple\u201d with her then-husband. A recent TV episode of \u201cHouse Hunters\" featured three adults searching for a home to build their polyamorous nest, and Hollywood celebrities are opening up about their polyamorous lifestyles as well.\n\nLifestyle personality Aubrey Marcus says he has been in an open relationship with his fiance Whitney Miller since 2013. He gives advice on ethical non-monogamy on his website.\n\n\u201cThere is plenty of evidence that consensual non-monogamy is an emerging civil rights movement,\u201d said Heath Schechinger, a counseling psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-chair of the Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force, recently created within the American Psychological Association. \u201cI've heard from a number of people advocating for relationship structure diversity over the past 20 years who are elated about this issue finally gaining traction.\u201d\n\nActivists are already working with elected officials in more than a dozen local governments, especially in California, to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class, \u201crelationship structure,\u201d said Berkeley psychologist and poly activist Dave Doleshal.\n\nMost efforts are at the informal stage but the city of Berkeley did consider a formal proposal to extend protections in housing, employment, business practices, city facilities or education to swingers, polyamorists and other non-monogamists. The proposal stalled last year amid concerns that it would have required employers to provide health insurance to numerous sexual and romantic partners outside of marriage.\n\nPro-polyamory marchers in San Francisco in 2004. Especially in California, there are moves afoot to expand local anti-discrimination ordinances to include a new protected class: \u201crelationship structure.\u201d\n\nUndaunted by that setback, advocates continue to generate a body of ideas and theories that normalize non-monogamy as a form of positive sexuality -- and possibly an identity -- following a script followed by other marginalized groups. Their efforts have led to reassessments of non-monogamy in the psychological and legal fields, contending the relationships are emotionally healthy and ethical, and thus forging a social movement with a shared identity, shared vocabulary, shared history and a shared desire for full recognition.\n\nAnd, yes, there is already a polyamory pride flag.\n\nOver the past two decades, nearly 600 academic papers have been written on the subject of non-monogamy, according to one count , including an assessment of the benefits to children in polyamorous families. Such research creates a body of scholarship to counteract ingrained social attitudes that poly advocates call prejudices and misconceptions. At the same time, the field has spawned more than 50 books, mostly written by women, said Kenneth Haslam, 85, a retired anesthesiologist and polyamorist in Durham, N.C., who helped create the polyamory history archive at the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Ind.\n\nBrian Watson, author of \u201cAnnals of Pornographie: How Porn Became \u2018Bad\u2019\u201d (2016), is co-authoring a book on non-monogamy throughout history. He said it will feature 50 to 100 prominent figures, such as Victor Hugo and Virginia Woolf, and is deliberately modeled on earlier works about famous gay people.\n\nJust as women\u2019s rights grew from feminist legal theory and LGBTQ rights from queer theory, non-monogamy is also developing its own historiography, scholarship and theoretical frameworks.\n\nThe polyamory flag. Advocates are laying the groundwork to have their cause become the next domino to fall in a long line of civil rights victories secured by trans people, gays, lesbians, women and blacks.\n\nStill, it's not easy to pinpoint a polyamorist profile. They are less likely to identify as heterosexual or to conform to gender norms, but academic studies and anecdotal evidence don't tell a single story. While some non-monogamists consider themselves neo-pagans, anarchists or socialists, others are libertarians or outwardly conventional suburbanites. Some studies say the lifestyle attracts more men, others say more women; some say it appeals to affluent whites, others say a polyamorist's average annual income is under $40,000.\n\nIn the legal arena, sympathetic scholars are arguing for the extension of legal reforms adopted in family law in recent decades in response to the continued erosion of the nuclear family, which is no longer America\u2019s dominant family structure.\n\nAt least a dozen states now recognize or allow for the possibility of a child having more than two parents, an accommodation for surrogate parents, grandparents, stepparents and other nontraditional families, according to a February legal article by Edward Stein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York.\n\nThese expansions of the legal concept of family are potential pathways for non-monogamous families to win legal rights of their own, Stein said. Another potential legal opening could be the existing precedents in domestic partnerships and civil unions that were set up locally for gays and lesbians before same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015. In both cases, legal victories for one group could be extended to another group, a common way that legal developments happen, he said.\n\nThe first steps would likely have to be decriminalizing of adultery in the 38 states that don\u2019t distinguish between consensual and non-consensual non-monogamy. The prohibition of adultery is comparable to anti-sodomy laws whose repeal by the Supreme Court in 2003 cleared an obstacle for recognizing gay marriage, Stein said.\n\nThe 1961 science fiction classic often cited as an inspiration by non-monogamists.\n\n\u201cI think what we will see is a lot of chipping away at the edges of some of the restrictions we put on what a family is and what a family does,\u201d said Janet W. Hardy, who has written on polyamory for more than 20 years. \u201cWhen the legal challenge comes \u2013 and it will \u2013 I don\u2019t think it will be from people who identify themselves as poly. I think it will come from blended families and some of the other ways that we are reforming around the idea of family that are legally challenging.\u201d\n\nOne such example was a recent effort by Hartford, Conn., authorities to evict eight adults and three children living as a single family in a 6,000-square-foot mansion.\n\nThe combined family was not polyamorous, said their lawyer, Peter Goselin, but shared financial, domestic and child-rearing responsibilities. In 2014 the city alleged a violation of its zoning rules for single-family homes, but after two years of litigation, the city dropped its case.\n\nThe joint owners and residents of the home claimed a constitutional right to define a family. The octet\u2019s lawsuit against the city includes a brief history of communal family living, from Iroquois longhouses, which housed up to 20 family units, to the communes, cooperatives and collective households of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\u201cThey saw the implications of it,\u201d Goselin said. \u201cPrivately they said to me we know this would be encouraging to a lot of people who are in polyamorous relationships.\u201d\n\nAdvocates say that the warnings against the perils of non-monogamy echo the now-debunked concerns about same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cAll of the well-known objections made against multi-person intimate relationships can be made against same- or opposite-sex monogamy as well, resulting in an indefensible double standard,\u201d Ronald C. Den Otter, a political science professor at California Polytechnic Institute wrote in a 2015 article in the Emory Law Review. \u201cSadly, many two-person intimate relationships are dysfunctional, and a closer, more brutally honest look at them should not inspire confidence in their superiority.\u201d\n\nPaul Mazursky's early Hollywood take on non-monogamy, 1969.\n\nOnce changes get under way, things can move quickly. The rise of the modern gay rights movement in the mid-20th century led to a decision by the American Psychiatric Association in 1973 to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders (gender dysphoria was de-pathologized in 2012). Those medical reversals are seen as analogous to the American Psychological Association\u2019s creation last year of its Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force, formed to destigmatize such relationships and explore changes in public policy.\n\nSchechinger, the task force co-chair, said it\u2019s much easier to stereotype and hate a marginalized group when people in the normative majority operate by stereotypes and misinformation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of what the task force is seeking to accomplish \u2013 to gather empirical data, promote accurate information about CNM relationships, and ask if these relationships are causing harm or are not,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what are the implications on society for promoting a one-size-fits-all model versus promoting people being in touch with what\u2019s the good fit for them.\u201d\n\nAs with the debates over human nature during the gay rights struggle, non-monogamy advocates are also raising the possibility that desiring multiple sexual partners is less a lifestyle choice and more of a sexual orientation. But there can be little doubt that non-monogamy, the norm in the animal kingdom, is natural, and that monogamy is a cultural ideal that developed in humans.\n\nBut the yen for sexual variety and adventure competes with an equally insistent bugbear: jealousy. And some believe that \u201cgreen-eyed monster of jealousy\u201d is the more powerful force, making it unlikely that most people could tolerate consensual non-monogamy for their partners and accept it is a social norm.\n\nKay Hymowitz: \u201cNormalizing consensual non-monogamy will become yet another way to \u2018privilege\u2019 male desire.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long run there\u2019s going to be some resistance because it\u2019s threatening to everybody else, because they recognize the desire for multiple partners is something they have, too,\u201d said David Barash, a zoologist and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, and author of \u201cThe Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People\u201d (2001). \u201cThey recognize it touches something within themselves that they\u2019d rather keep hidden.

The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom's Kink and Poly Aware Professionals referral list includes about 300 lawyers, said Susan Wright, the Baltimore-based organization's executive director.\n\nThe world of polyamory overlaps with the subculture of kink and BDSM, which refers to the erotic practices of bondage, domination, submission and sadomasochism. As a sign of the movement\u2019s maturation, some now embrace the kind of middle-class respectability that made gay marriage palatable to mainstream society.\n\n\"We\u2019re a very boring and respectable couple!\" polyamorist Carrie Ichikawa Jenkins beamed to The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2017.

In a 2015 article, he predicted that the civil rights challenges were inevitable, but initially judges would \u201cswat away on procedural grounds the first few constitutional challenges to marriage laws.\u201d Gradually the legal objections will give way to the force of logical consistency.\n\nHe told RealClearInvestigations in an email that this process is often characterized by indignant dismissal of the logical implications, followed by total capitulation.\n\n\u201cOf course, advocates of revising the law denounced us not only as \u2018bigots\u2019 but as \u2018scare-mongers,\u2019\u201d George said. \u201cThere was, they insisted, no \u2018slippery slope\u2019 from same-sex marriage to polyamory. The two concepts had nothing to do with each other.\n\n\u201cI could see that this was nonsense \u2014 often disingenuous nonsense,\u201d George said. \u201cSo I am not in the least surprised to see what is happening now. We have quickly gone from, \u2018It will never happen,\u2019 to \u2018You\u2019re a bigot for thinking there is anything wrong with it.\u2019\u201d",
