        "content": "Barring some unforeseen event , such as a serious terrorist attack at home , the decisive event that will determine who wins the 2016 presidential election is almost certainly going to be the series of debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump . beginning on September 26 at New York \u2019 s Hofstra University .\nSince 1960 , when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon first met in Chicago , no other single moment has been more important in affecting the outcome of our elections . For good or ill , television \u2019 s laser-like eye reveals the candidates \u2019 fitness for the presidency\u2014their knowledge of domestic and foreign policy , their ability to answer reporters \u2019 probing questions , their coolness under fire , the image they project\u2014all tell voters which person should occupy the Oval Office .\nHistory tells us so . Vice President Richard Nixon entered a Chicago television studio on Sept. 26 , 1960 , confident that he could defeat Sen. Kennedy . After all , he had proven himself a master of television , which was already showing its great ability to affect American politics .\nWhen he was a candidate for vice president in 1952 , television had saved his career when a potential scandal\u2014the existence of a private fund created by businessmen to defray his travel and other expenses\u2014threatened his place on the Republican ticket . Party officials wanted him to leave and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower was leaning in that direction when Nixon decided to take his fate in his own hands . The result was the famous \u201c Checkers Speech \u201d when Nixon , with adoring wife Pat looking on bravely , shrewdly crafted a narrative every American could believe and take pride in . He was everyman : veteran of the Pacific war ( \u201c I was just there when the bombs were falling \u201d ) ; devoted husband ( \u201c Pat doesn \u2019 t have a mink coat\u2026 but I tell her she looks good in anything \u201d ) ; father of two darling daughters ; public servant barely getting by on his government salary . And borrowing a tactic from FDR , he made his dog Checkers the most famous cocker spaniel in America . In closing , he urged Republicans to write or wire their national committee about whether he should stay or go .\nThe response was overwhelmingly positive and Nixon , at 39 , eventually became the second youngest vice president in history . So he had nothing to fear about debating John F. Kennedy . Unfortunately , he was not at his best that September night . Campaigning in North Carolina earlier , he had banged his knee on a car door , ignored the continuing discomfort and wound up in Walter Reed Hospital with an infection that took him from the campaign for several weeks . After recovering , he rushed to catch up , caught a cold , which he ignored , and entered the television studio underweight , pale , and feverish . He looked terrible , especially when contrasted with Sen. Kennedy , who was tanned and rested . Immediately , his advantage as the experienced vice president disappeared , replaced by a man obviously nervous , perspiring , seemingly unready for the presidency .\nNarrowly defeated by Kennedy , Nixon learned from his mistakes . As the Republican presidential nominee in 1968 , Nixon chose not to debate his Democratic opponent , Vice President Hubert Humphrey . Instead , under the tutelage of media guru Roger Ailes , he used television brilliantly , appearing in a series of campaign appearance dubbed \u201c the man in the arena , \u201d in which Nixon answered softball questions from friendly audiences . He won . Four years later , running for re-election , he rejected Sen. George McGovern \u2019 s call for a debate and never again subjected himself to that kind of format .\nTaking office when Nixon resigned , Gerald Ford\u2014the first unelected vice president to succeed to the presidency\u2014could not avoid a debate in the post-Watergate America of 1976 . It proved to be his undoing . Stung by his pardon of Richard Nixon and faced with rising inflation and a weak economy , Ford stumbled badly during his second debate with Gov . Jimmy Carter . Discussing Soviet-American relations , he remarked that Russia did not dominate Eastern Europe and never would \u201c under a Ford administration. \u201d Immediately recognizing Ford \u2019 s gaffe , Carter , grinning like the Cheshire cat , said that the president \u2019 s statement would surprise Polish and Czech Americans whose relatives lived behind the Iron Curtain . In the days that followed , Ford tried to clarify his remarks but the damage was done . Carter was on his way to the White House .\nAnd so it went in succeeding elections\u2014whoever won the debate won the presidency . Political junkies will recall those moments . The year 1988 : Michael Dukakis \u2019 s tepid response when asked if he would \u201c favor an irrevocable death penalty \u201d for a man who had brutally raped and murdered his wife , Kitty . \u201c No , I don \u2019 t , Bernard , \u201d he replied softly to CNN \u2019 s Bernard Shaw . \u201c And I think you know that I \u2019 ve opposed the death penalty during all my life. \u201d The journalist Roger Simon later recalled the reactions of his colleagues in the press room : \u201c He \u2019 s through. \u201d \u201c That \u2019 s all she wrote. \u201d \u201c Get the hook. \u201d They were right : Dukakis , now appearing to be a bloodless technocrat , lost to George H.W . Bush .\nIn 1992 it was Bush \u2019 s turn to stumble . Debating Bill Clinton and Ross Perot , Bush seemed indifferent to a questioner from the audience who had been harmed by the recession . The cameras caught him looking at his watch ( he later admitted thinking , \u201c only 10 more minutes of this crap \u201d ) . Clinton immediately sensed an opportunity and moved closer to the woman , seeking more information about how she was faring in hard times . Clinton \u2019 s empathy won the night and the presidency .\nBut it \u2019 s the 1980 campaign that bears the closest resemblance to today \u2019 s Clinton-Trump contest . President Jimmy Carter , badly weakened by economic woes and his failure to win the release of the American hostages held captive by the Iranians for almost a year , faced Gov . Ronald Reagan , whom many thought too conservative and hawkish to become president . Carter went further : imitating LBJ \u2019 s attacks on his 1964 opponent Barry Goldwater , he painted Reagan as reckless and dangerous , his anti-Russian mania a threat to national security : \u201c Reagan will lead us into war , \u201d Carter claimed as the campaign drew to a close . Carter \u2019 s vitriolic rhetoric created another problem for the beleaguered president : The press began to attack him as an extremist , the embodiment of \u201c meanness . \u201d\nThe turning point came during Carter and Reagan \u2019 s debate in Cleveland , Ohio , on October 28 , 1980 . As the two men went to their podiums , Carter aide Vernon Jordan became immediately alarmed . \u201c I didn \u2019 t like what I saw , \u201d Jordan later recalled . \u201c Reagan looked relaxed , smiling , robust ; the President , erect , lips tight , looking like a coiled spring\u2026 an over-trained boxer , too ready for the bout. \u201d Each time Carter hurled a verbal barb , Reagan chuckled , and with a gentle toss of the head , remarked , \u201c There you go again. \u201d Reagan \u2019 s affability did not fit the image Carter had tried to create .\nLater , Carter complained that Reagan , the former B-movie actor , had \u201c memorized \u201d his best \u201c lines , and he pushes a button and they come out. \u201d He was confident that \u201c the issues are more important than the performance. \u201d He was wrong , as the Reagan landslide shortly proved .\nIf the history of presidential debates proves anything , it is that performance trumps issues . Time and again , Americans have elected the person who demonstrates not just intelligence but strength , stability , and some indefinable quality\u2014empathy , perhaps , or simple humanity .\nHillary Clinton faces a unique challenge when she faces Donald Trump . He is sui generis , one of kind , unlike anyone else who has ever sought the presidency . He has no programs she can attack , only proclamations\u2014a wall will be built , law and order will return , new jobs will appear , terrorism will be defeated\u2014all will be achieved , as if by magic , after he takes the presidential oath . So far , that strategy has succeeded , at least in some Republican circles .\nWill attacking such fiats as empty promises offered by an unqualified , even dangerous , opponent create sympathy for Trump as Carter \u2019 s attacks did for Reagan in 1980 ? Only if Trump borrows a page from the Reagan playbook and shrugs them off with a smile . But is he likely to do that ? His behavior during the Republican debates suggests that he won \u2019 t because he is incapable of dealing quietly with anyone who strikes at the Trump brand . Vanity is his Achilles \u2019 heel . Insulting his opponents is his style\u2014 \u201c Little Marco , \u201d \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted , \u201d \u201c Listless Jeb , \u201d \u201c Crooked Hillary . \u201d\nIt is thought that Trump \u2019 s unpredictability puts Clinton at a disadvantage . How does one prepare to face a man who has broken all the rules of American politics ? In fact , however , Trump is very predictable . He has only one response\u2014to insult . It is Hillary who should imitate Reagan , laugh at Trump \u2019 s attacks , and insist that her programs , not Trump \u2019 s empty promises , can improve the lives of Americans .\nOf course , there is the possibility that there will be no debates this year . Late on Friday night , July 29 , Trump tweeted , \u201c As usual , Hillary and the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games . Same as last time w/Bernie . Unacceptable ! \u201d In fact , the debate schedule , created by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates , has been set for almost a year . Later , Trump denied that he was trying to skip the debates , and yesterday , Rudy Giuliani told CNN \u2019 s Chris Cuomo that \u201c Donald Trump is going to participate in all three debates \u201d and that he had been charged to oversee their arrangement . Nevertheless , Trump has warned that \u201c certain moderators would be unacceptable , absolutely . \u2026I will demand fair moderators . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s unlikely that Trump will be able to avoid a face-off with Clinton , but he may be able to reduce the number to the one evening\u2014Wednesday , Oct. 19 , which does not conflict with football .

        "authors": "Matthew Sheffield",
        "content": "On Tuesday , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell formally decided to call off a health care vote that he and other senior Republicans had been pushing toward for weeks .\nStraddling a mere two-seat majority in the chamber , McConnell had to beat a hasty retreat after a number of his members indicated that they would not support the Senate 's version of the Obamacare repeal bill , officially called the Better Care Reconciliation Act . The cancellation paralleled an earlier move in March by the House GOP leader Paul Ryan to scuttle a vote doomed to fail .\nOne person who saw all this coming was former House Speaker John Boehner . Out of Congress since the end of 2015 following a conservative attack on his leadership , Boehner told a high-dollar health care industry conference in February of this year that there was no way that Republicans were going to be able to \u201c repeal and replace \u201d the Affordable Care Act .\n`` In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress , Republicans never , ever , one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like . Not once , \u201d Boehner told attendees , according to a report by Politico \u2019 s Darius Tahir .\nBoehner continued , recounting that he had advised his former colleagues not to waste their time with bills that would merely repeal Obamacare without implementing some sort of alternative system .\n\u201c All this happy talk that went on in November and December and January about repeal , repeal , repeal , \u201d Boehner said . \u201c If you pass repeal without replace you 'll never pass replace , because they will never , ever agree on what the bill should be . Perfect always becomes the enemy of the good . \u201d\nInstead of repealing Obamacare , Boehner argued , Republicans should make smaller tweaks around its edges , eliminating some of the most unpopular aspects .\nIn that scenario , the former GOP leader said , Republicans would basically `` fix the flaws [ of the existing law ] and put a more conservative box around it . ''\nBoehner \u2019 s predictive record has been better than Nostradamus since then . And the reason is simple : Republicans are bad at health care . McConnell , one of the Senate \u2019 s savviest operators in a generation , seems to have been aware of this . It \u2019 s why , in 2014 , he essentially said that making smaller changes to the Affordable Care Act was his preference . At a Tuesday evening news conference , McConnell signaled to his caucus that he would reach a bipartisan deal with Democrats if Republicans could n't get to agreement .\nBeyond the wide policy differences between his members that have always made McConnell 's job difficult , the GOP 's health care proposal is extraordinarily unpopular . The House \u2019 s version of the bill had a 16 percent approval rating in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll . According to Chris Warsaw , a MIT assistant professor of political science , the bill is even more disliked than the original version of health care reform that spooked Democrats in 1993 .\nAs currently written , either chamber 's bill almost certainly will endanger the party \u2019 s senators in purple states . Normally , politicians are loathe to stick their necks out for proposals that are unpopular , even if they agree with them . So why bother ?\nObviously , political ideology is playing a huge part . Conservatives have long wanted to slash the federal budget or \u201c drown it in the bathtub , \u201d in the infamous words of Americans for Tax Reform \u2019 s Grover Norquist . Unified GOP control of the Congress and presidency is a great opportunity in that regard .\nBut ideology alone doesn \u2019 t explain why Republicans are promoting a piece of legislation that is literally the most unpopular bill in the recent history of opinion polling .\nThe first reason the GOP is pushing for such an unpopular piece of legislation is what might be called the conservative establishment . This loosely connected network of activists and talk show hosts has been whipped into a frenzy for seven years about the horrors of Obamacare . Failing to give them some sizable piece of legislation that they could call `` repeal '' will engender media attacks and primary challenges .\nParty officials are also worried that if Republicans ca n't manage to achieve some sort of repeal , this will turn off many reliably conservative voters in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections . That matters because , thanks to President Donald Trump , the Democratic base is highly energized . If Republicans can \u2019 t get their own team to show up for the vote , they could face heavy losses .\nThe second pressure on the GOP is its donors . At a conference last week sponsored by billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch , several of the Republican Party 's largest benefactors flat-out threatened to close the money spigot unless Republicans in Washington pass major legislation on health care and taxes .\nA third reason why congressional Republicans might pass a bill that could well endanger their own re-election prospects is their sheer ignorance of political reality . According to a 2013 academic paper , GOP elected officials think their constituents are much more conservative than they really are .

        "content_original": "On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell formally decided to call off a health care vote that he and other senior Republicans had been pushing toward for weeks.\n\nStraddling a mere two-seat majority in the chamber, McConnell had to beat a hasty retreat after a number of his members indicated that they would not support the Senate's version of the Obamacare repeal bill, officially called the Better Care Reconciliation Act. The cancellation paralleled an earlier move in March by the House GOP leader Paul Ryan to scuttle a vote doomed to fail.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne person who saw all this coming was former House Speaker John Boehner. Out of Congress since the end of 2015 following a conservative attack on his leadership, Boehner told a high-dollar health care industry conference in February of this year that there was no way that Republicans were going to be able to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not once,\u201d Boehner told attendees, according to a report by Politico\u2019s Darius Tahir.\n\nBoehner continued, recounting that he had advised his former colleagues not to waste their time with bills that would merely repeal Obamacare without implementing some sort of alternative system.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cAll this happy talk that went on in November and December and January about repeal, repeal, repeal,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cIf you pass repeal without replace you'll never pass replace, because they will never, ever agree on what the bill should be. Perfect always becomes the enemy of the good.\u201d\n\nInstead of repealing Obamacare, Boehner argued, Republicans should make smaller tweaks around its edges, eliminating some of the most unpopular aspects.\n\nIn that scenario, the former GOP leader said, Republicans would basically \"fix the flaws [of the existing law] and put a more conservative box around it.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBoehner\u2019s predictive record has been better than Nostradamus since then. And the reason is simple: Republicans are bad at health care. McConnell, one of the Senate\u2019s savviest operators in a generation, seems to have been aware of this. It\u2019s why, in 2014, he essentially said that making smaller changes to the Affordable Care Act was his preference. At a Tuesday evening news conference, McConnell signaled to his caucus that he would reach a bipartisan deal with Democrats if Republicans couldn't get to agreement.\n\nBeyond the wide policy differences between his members that have always made McConnell's job difficult, the GOP's health care proposal is extraordinarily unpopular. The House\u2019s version of the bill had a 16 percent approval rating in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll. According to Chris Warsaw, a MIT assistant professor of political science, the bill is even more disliked than the original version of health care reform that spooked Democrats in 1993.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs currently written, either chamber's bill almost certainly will endanger the party\u2019s senators in purple states. Normally, politicians are loathe to stick their necks out for proposals that are unpopular, even if they agree with them. So why bother?\n\nObviously, political ideology is playing a huge part. Conservatives have long wanted to slash the federal budget or \u201cdrown it in the bathtub,\u201d in the infamous words of Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s Grover Norquist. Unified GOP control of the Congress and presidency is a great opportunity in that regard.\n\nBut ideology alone doesn\u2019t explain why Republicans are promoting a piece of legislation that is literally the most unpopular bill in the recent history of opinion polling.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe first reason the GOP is pushing for such an unpopular piece of legislation is what might be called the conservative establishment. This loosely connected network of activists and talk show hosts has been whipped into a frenzy for seven years about the horrors of Obamacare. Failing to give them some sizable piece of legislation that they could call \"repeal\" will engender media attacks and primary challenges.\n\nParty officials are also worried that if Republicans can't manage to achieve some sort of repeal, this will turn off many reliably conservative voters in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections. That matters because, thanks to President Donald Trump, the Democratic base is highly energized. If Republicans can\u2019t get their own team to show up for the vote, they could face heavy losses.\n\nThe second pressure on the GOP is its donors. At a conference last week sponsored by billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, several of the Republican Party's largest benefactors flat-out threatened to close the money spigot unless Republicans in Washington pass major legislation on health care and taxes.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nA third reason why congressional Republicans might pass a bill that could well endanger their own re-election prospects is their sheer ignorance of political reality. According to a 2013 academic paper, GOP elected officials think their constituents are much more conservative than they really are. In fact, according to the study, nearly half of all the Republican politicians surveyed believed their voters were more conservative than those found in the furthest-right political districts in the country.\n\nA final reason why Republicans are sure to press forward with some kind of health care bill, after they lick their wounds and return from the July 4 recess, is that most of the spending cuts in the Senate and House bills will affect people on Medicaid. The Senate\u2019s bill, for example, reduces the program\u2019s budget by $772 billion. In the GOP mythos, most of the individuals on Medicaid are poor people in big cities who are likely to vote for Democrats. Lowering Medicaid payments, in the minds of these Republicans, is merely taking money away from lazy slackers who don't deserve public assistance.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway perfectly illustrated this attitude in a Monday morning interview on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d suggesting that the only people on Medicaid are people who choose not to work.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is intended for the poor, the needy and the sick,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you have an able-bodied American who again is not poor, sick, needy \u2014 we\u2019re not talking about the elderly who benefit, the children, the pregnant women, the disabled \u2014 if you\u2019re able-bodied and you would like to go find employment and have employer-sponsored benefits, then you should be able to do that, and maybe you belong, as [Health and Human Services] Secretary [Tom] Price has made clear, in other places.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs was true in the case about how conservative the typical voter is, however, reality is different from Republican perception. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 59 percent of adults on Medicaid have jobs. About 80 percent are part of a working family. Many of the remainder of people on Medicaid are people who cannot work, such as individuals in retirement homes.\n\nEven worse for the GOP is that many Medicaid recipients are Republican voters.\n\nCombined with Republicans' ideological urge to cut government spending, these four factors explain why the GOP is going down a path that can only be described as suicidal.

        "content": "( CNN ) It would be hard to think of a more damaging day for a President than one on which his former campaign chairman disappeared behind bars for years to come . But Paul Manafort 's new sentence was the least of Donald Trump 's worries Wednesday as his Russia investigation nightmare took yet another turn for the worse .\nNew suspicions about dangled pardons , conflicting congressional testimony , implicit pleas for clemency and fresh suggestions of inappropriate presidential behavior delivered a new twist to the drama with Washington already on edge in anticipation of special counsel Robert Mueller 's final report .\nA new firestorm erupted over disputed assertions that ex-acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker did not deny in a closed congressional meeting that he had spoken with President Donald Trump about a case involving Trump 's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen .\nCNN reported explosive new revelations involving Cohen 's allegation that a pardon had been dangled in exchange for him staying loyal to the President , in which he was purportedly told he could be sure he had `` friends in high places .

        "content": "On a third-down play last season , the Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith stood in shotgun formation , five yards behind the line of scrimmage . As he called his signals , a Houston Texans cornerback , Kareem Jackson , suddenly sprinted forward from a position four yards behind the defensive line . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . Jackson \u2019 s timing was perfect . The ball was snapped . The Texans \u2019 left defensive end , J.J. Watt , sprinted to the outside , taking the Redskins \u2019 right tackle with him . The defensive tackle on Watt \u2019 s right rushed to the inside , taking the offensive right guard with him . The result was a huge gap in the Redskins \u2019 line , through which Jackson could run unblocked . He quickly sacked Smith , for a loss of 13 yards . Special-teams players began taking the field for the punt . But Smith didn \u2019 t get up . He rolled flat onto his back , pulled off his helmet , and covered his face with his hands . He was clearly in excruciating pain . The slow-motion replay immediately showed the television audience why : As Smith was tackled , his right leg had buckled sharply above the ankle , with his foot rotating significantly away from any direction in which a human foot ought to point . The play-by-play announcer Greg Gumbel said grimly , \u201c We \u2019 ll be back , \u201d and the network abruptly cut to a break . There was nothing more to say .\nEven without the benefit of medical training , and even without conducting a physical examination , viewers knew what had happened . They may not have known what the bones were called or what treatment would be required , but they knew more than enough , and they knew what really mattered : Smith had broken his leg , very badly . They knew that even if they were not orthopedists , did not have a medical degree , and had never cracked open a copy of Gray \u2019 s Anatomy . They could tell\u2014they were certain\u2014something was seriously wrong . And so it is , or ought to be , with Donald Trump . You don \u2019 t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows , and you don \u2019 t need to be a mental-health professional to see that something \u2019 s very seriously off with Trump\u2014particularly after nearly three years of watching his erratic and abnormal behavior in the White House . Questions about Trump \u2019 s psychological stability have mounted throughout his presidency . But those questions have been coming even more frequently amid a recent escalation in Trump \u2019 s bizarre behavior , as the pressures of his upcoming reelection campaign , a possibly deteriorating economy , and now a full-blown impeachment inquiry have mounted . And the questioners have included those who have worked most closely with him . No president in recent memory\u2014and likely no president ever\u2014has prompted more discussion about his mental stability and connection with reality . Trump \u2019 s former chief of staff John Kelly is said to have described him as \u201c unhinged , \u201d and \u201c off the rails , \u201d and to have called the White House \u201c Crazytown \u201d because of Trump \u2019 s unbalanced state . Trump \u2019 s former deputy attorney general , Rod Rosenstein , once reportedly discussed recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment , the Constitution \u2019 s provision addressing presidential disability , including mental disability .\nRead more : Donald Trump \u2019 s 50 most unthinkable moments Rosenstein denies that claim , but it is not the only such account . A senior administration official , writing anonymously in The New York Times last September , described how , \u201c given the instability many witnessed , there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment \u201d \u2014but \u201c no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. \u201d And NBC News last week quoted someone familiar with current discussions in the White House warning that there is \u201c increasing wariness that , as this impeachment inquiry drags out , the likelihood increases that the president could respond erratically and become \u2018 unmanageable. \u2019 \u201d In September , a former White House official offered a similar assessment to a Business Insider reporter : \u201c No one knows what to expect from him anymore , \u201d because \u201c his mood changes from one minute to the next based on some headline or tweet , and the next thing you know his entire schedule gets tossed out the window . He \u2019 s losing his shit. \u201d Even a major investment bank has gotten into the mix , albeit in a roundabout way : JPMorgan Chase has created a \u201c Volfefe Index \u201d \u2014named after Trump \u2019 s bizarre May 2017 \u201c covfefe \u201d tweet\u2014designed to quantify the effect that Trump \u2019 s impulsive tweets have on interest-rate volatility . The bank \u2019 s press release understatedly observed that its \u201c volatility fair value model \u201d shows that \u201c the president \u2019 s remarks on this social media platform [ have ] played a statistically significant role in elevating implied volatility . \u201d\nThe president isn \u2019 t simply volatile and erratic , however\u2014he \u2019 s also incapable of consistently telling the truth . Those who work closely with him , and who aren \u2019 t in denial , must deal with Trump \u2019 s lying about serious matters virtually every day . But as one former official put it , they \u201c are used to the president saying things that aren \u2019 t true , \u201d and have inured themselves to it . Trump \u2019 s own former communications director Anthony Scaramucci has on multiple occasions described Trump as a liar , once saying , \u201c We \u2026 know he \u2019 s telling lies , \u201d so \u201c if you want me to say he \u2019 s a liar , I \u2019 m happy to say he \u2019 s a liar. \u201d He went on to address Trump directly : \u201c You should probably dial down the lying because you don \u2019 t need to \u2026 So dial that down , and you \u2019 ll be doing a lot better. \u201d That was good advice , but clearly wishful thinking . Trump simply can \u2019 t dial down the lying , or turn it off\u2014even , his own attorneys suggest , when false statements may be punished as crimes . A lawyer who has represented him in business disputes once told me that Trump couldn \u2019 t sensibly be allowed to speak with Special Counsel Robert Mueller , because Trump would \u201c lie his ass off \u201d \u2014in effect , that Trump simply wasn \u2019 t capable of telling the truth , about anything , and that if he ever spoke to a prosecutor , he \u2019 d talk himself into jail . Trump \u2019 s lawyers in the Russia investigation clearly agreed : As Bob Woodward recounts at length in his book Fear , members of Trump \u2019 s criminal-defense team fought both Trump and Mueller tooth and nail to keep Trump from being interviewed by the Office of Special Counsel . A practice testimonial session ended with Trump spouting wild , baseless assertions in a rage . Woodward quotes Trump \u2019 s outside counsel John Dowd as saying that Trump \u201c just made something up \u201d in response to one question . \u201c That \u2019 s his nature. \u201d Woodward also recounts Dowd \u2019 s thinking when he argued to Trump that the president was \u201c not really capable \u201d of answering Mueller \u2019 s questions face to face . Dowd had \u201c to dress it up as much as possible , to say , it \u2019 s not your fault \u2026 He could not say what he knew was true : \u2018 You \u2019 re a fucking liar. \u2019 That was the problem. \u201d ( Dowd disputes this account . ) Which raises the question : If Trump can \u2019 t tell the truth even when it counts most , with legal jeopardy on the line and lawyers there to help prepare him , is he able to apprehend the truth at all ?\nBehavior like this is unusual , a point that journalists across the political spectrum have made . \u201c This is not normal , \u201d Megan McArdle wrote in late August . \u201c And I don \u2019 t mean that as in , \u2018 Trump is violating the shibboleths of the Washington establishment. \u2019 I mean that as in , \u2018 This is not normal for a functioning adult. \u2019 \u201d James Fallows observed , also in August , that Trump is having \u201c episodes of what would be called outright lunacy , if they occurred in any other setting , \u201d and that if he \u201c were in virtually any other position of responsibility , action would already be under way to remove him from that role. \u201d Trump \u2019 s erratic behavior has long been the subject of political criticism , late-night-television jokes , and even speculation about whether it \u2019 s part of some incomprehensible , multidimensional strategic game . But it \u2019 s relevant to whether he \u2019 s fit for the office he holds . Simply put , Trump \u2019 s ingrained and extreme behavioral characteristics make it impossible for him to carry out the duties of the presidency in the way the Constitution requires . To see why first requires a look at what the Constitution demands of a president , and then an examination of how Trump \u2019 s behavioral characteristics preclude his ability to fulfill those demands . The Framers of the Constitution expected the presidency to be occupied by special individuals , selfless people of the highest character and ability . They intended the Electoral College to be a truly deliberative body , not the largely ceremonial institution it has become today . Because the Electoral College , unlike Congress and the state legislatures , wouldn \u2019 t be a permanent body , and because it involved diffuse selections made in the various states , they hoped it would help avoid \u201c cabal , intrigue and corruption , \u201d as Alexander Hamilton put it in \u201c Federalist No . 68 , \u201d and deter interference from \u201c these most deadly adversaries of republican government , \u201d especially \u201c from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils . \u201d\nThough the Constitution \u2019 s drafters could hardly have foreseen how the system would evolve , they certainly knew the kind of person they wanted it to produce . \u201c The process of election affords a moral certainty , \u201d Hamilton wrote , \u201c that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. \u201d \u201c Talents for low intrigue , and the little arts of popularity , \u201d might suffice for someone to be elected to the governorship of a state , but not the presidency . Election would \u201c require other talents , and a different kind of merit , \u201d to gain \u201c the esteem and confidence of the whole Union , \u201d or enough of it to win the presidency . As a result , there would be \u201c a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue. \u201d This was the Framers \u2019 goal in designing the system that would make \u201c the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. \u201d Read more : The presidency is the hardest job in the world Hamilton \u2019 s use of the word trust in The Federalist Papers to describe the presidency was no accident . The Framers intended that the president \u201c be like a fiduciary , who must pursue the public interest in good faith republican fashion rather than pursuing his self-interest , and who must diligently and steadily execute Congress \u2019 s commands , \u201d as a recent Harvard Law Review article puts it . The concept is akin to the law of private fiduciaries , which governs trustees of trusts and directors and officers of corporations , an area that has been central to my legal practice as a corporate litigator . \u201c Indeed , \u201d as the Harvard Law Review article explains , \u201c one might argue that what presents to us as private fiduciary law today had some of its genesis in the law of public officeholding. \u201d The overarching principle is that a fiduciary\u2014say , the CEO of a corporation\u2014when acting on behalf of a corporation , has to act in the corporation \u2019 s best interests . Likewise , a trustee of a trust must use the assets for the benefit of the beneficiary , and not himself ( a fundamental rule , incidentally , that Trump apparently couldn \u2019 t adhere to with his own charitable foundation ) .\nIn providing for a national chief executive , the Framers incorporated the very similar law of public officeholding into his duties in two places in the Constitution\u2014in Article II , Section 3 ( the president \u201c shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed \u201d ) , and in Article II , Section 1 , Clause 8 , which requires the president to \u201c solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States. \u201d That language\u2014particularly the words faithfully execute\u2014was in 1787 \u201c very commonly associated with the performance of public and private offices , \u201d the Harvard Law Review article points out , and \u201c anyone experienced in law or government \u201d at that time would have recognized what it meant , \u201c because it was so basic to \u2026 the law of executive officeholding. \u201d In a nutshell , while carrying out his official duties , a president has to put the country , not himself , first ; he must faithfully follow and enforce the law ; and he must act with the utmost care in doing all that . But can Trump do all that ? Does his personality allow him to ? Answering those questions doesn \u2019 t require mental-health expertise , nor does it really require a diagnosis . You can make the argument for Trump \u2019 s unfitness without assessing his mental health : Like James Fallows , for example , you could just ask whether Trump would have been allowed to retain any other job in light of his bizarre conduct . At the same time , the presence of a mental disorder or disturbance doesn \u2019 t necessarily translate to incapacity ; to suggest otherwise would unfairly stigmatize tens of millions of Americans . Someone battling a serious psychological ailment can unquestionably function well , and even nobly , in high public office\u2014including as president . The country , in fact , has seen it : Abraham Lincoln endured \u201c no mere case of the blues \u201d ; he suffered such \u201c terrible melancholly , \u201d said one of his contemporaries , that \u201c he never dare [ d ] carry a knife in his pocket. \u201d Many historians speculate that he suffered from what we would now diagnose as clinical depression . Yet Lincoln \u2019 s mechanisms for coping with his lifelong affliction may have supplied him with the vision , the creativity , and the moral fortitude to save the nation , to achieve for it a new birth of freedom . As a writer in this magazine once put it : Lincoln \u2019 s \u201c political vision drew power from personal experience \u2026 Prepared for defeat , and even for humiliation , he insisted on seeing the truth of both his personal circumstances and the national condition . And where the optimists of his time would fail , he would succeed , envisioning and articulating a durable idea of free society . \u201d\nMore than a diagnosis , what truly matters , as Lincoln \u2019 s case shows , is the president \u2019 s behavioral characteristics and personality traits . And understanding how people behave and think is not the sole province of professionals ; we all do it every day , with family members , co-workers , and others . Nevertheless , how the mental-health community goes about categorizing those characteristics and traits can provide helpful guidance to laypeople by structuring our thinking about them . Read more : Donald Trump is not well And that \u2019 s where the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders comes into play . The DSM , now in its fifth edition , \u201c contains descriptions , symptoms , and other criteria for diagnosing mental disorders , \u201d and serves as the country \u2019 s \u201c authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders. \u201d What \u2019 s useful for nonprofessionals is that , for the most part , it \u2019 s written in plain English , and its criteria consist largely of observable behaviors\u2014words and actions . That \u2019 s especially true of its criteria for personality disorders\u2014they don \u2019 t require a person to lie on a couch and confess his or her innermost thoughts . They turn on how a person behaves in the wild , so to speak . If anything , a patient \u2019 s confessions in an office may disadvantage a clinician , because patients can and do conceal from clinicians central aspects of their true selves . If you can observe people going about their everyday business , you \u2019 ll know a lot more about how they act and behave .\nAnd Donald Trump , as president of the United States , is probably the most observable and observed person in the world . I \u2019 ve personally met and spoken with him only a few times , but anyone who knows him will tell you that Trump , in a way , has no facade : What you see of him publicly is what you get all the time , although you may get more of it in private . Any intelligent person who watches Trump closely on television , and pays careful attention to his words on Twitter and in the press , should be able to tell you as much about his behavior as a mental-health professional could . One scholarly paper has suggested that accounts of a person \u2019 s behavior from laypeople who observe him might be more accurate than information from a clinical interview , and that this is especially true when considering two personality disorders in particular\u2014what the DSM calls narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder . These two disorders just happen to be the ones that have most commonly been ascribed to Trump by mental-health professionals over the past four years . Of these two disorders , the more commonly discussed when it comes to Trump is narcissistic personality disorder , or NPD\u2014pathological narcissism . It \u2019 s also more important in considering Trump \u2019 s fitness for office , because it touches directly upon whether Trump has the capacity to put anyone \u2019 s interests\u2014including the country \u2019 s and the Constitution \u2019 s\u2014above his own .\nNarcissus , the Greek mythological figure , was a boy who fell so in love with his own reflection in a pool of water that , according to one version of the story , he jumped in and drowned . Psychiatrists and psychologists now use the term narcissism to describe feelings of self-importance and self-love . As Craig Malkin , a clinical psychologist who has written extensively on the subject , has explained , narcissism is a trait that , to some extent , all human beings have : \u201c the drive to feel special , to stand out from \u2026 other [ s ] \u2026 to feel exceptional or unique. \u201d A certain amount of narcissism is healthy , and helpful\u2014it brings with it confidence , optimism , and boldness . Someone with more than an average amount of narcissism may be called a narcissist . Many politicians , and many celebrities , could be considered narcissists ; presidents seem especially likely to \u201c rank high in extroverted narcissism , \u201d Malkin writes , although they have varied greatly in the degree of their narcissism . But extreme narcissism can be pathological , an illness\u2014and potentially a danger , as it was for Narcissus . \u201c Pathological narcissism begins when people become so addicted to feeling special that , just like with any drug , they \u2019 ll do anything to get their \u2018 high , \u2019 including lie , steal , cheat , betray , and even hurt those closest to them , \u201d Malkin says . The \u201c fundamental life goal \u201d of an extreme narcissist \u201c is to promote the greatness of the self , for all to see , \u201d the psychologist Dan P. McAdams wrote in \u2588\u2588\u2588 . To many mental-health professionals , Donald Trump provides a perfect example of such extreme , pathological narcissism : One clinical psychologist told Vanity Fair that he considers Trump such a \u201c classic \u201d pathological narcissist that he is actually \u201c archiving video clips of him to use in workshops because there \u2019 s no better example \u201d of the characteristics of the disorder he displays . \u201c Otherwise , \u201d this clinician explained , \u201c I would have had to hire actors and write vignettes . He \u2019 s like a dream come true. \u201d Another clinical psychologist said that Trump displays \u201c textbook narcissistic personality disorder . \u201d\nNot everyone agrees that Trump meets the diagnostic criteria for NPD . Allen Frances , a psychiatrist who helped write the disorder \u2019 s entry in the DSM , has argued that a mental \u201c disturbance \u201d becomes a \u201c disorder \u201d only when , as the DSM puts it , the affliction \u201c causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , or other important areas of functioning. \u201d The idea behind this threshold is to separate \u201c mild forms \u201d of problems from pathological ones , \u201c in the absence of clear biological markers or clinically useful measurements of severity for many mental disorders. \u201d In Frances \u2019 s view , that dividing line disqualifies Trump from having a disorder , particularly NPD . Trump \u201c may be a world-class narcissist , \u201d he has written , \u201c but this doesn \u2019 t make him mentally ill , because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder . Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded , rather than punished , for his grandiosity , self-absorption and lack of empathy. \u201d But from the perspective of the public at large , the debate over whether Trump meets the clinical diagnostic criteria for NPD\u2014or whether psychiatrists can and should answer that question without directly examining him\u2014is beside the point . The goal of a diagnosis is to help a clinician guide treatment . The question facing the public is very different : Does the president of the United States exhibit a consistent pattern of behavior that suggests he is incapable of properly discharging the duties of his office ?\nEven Trump \u2019 s own allies recognize the degree of his narcissism . When he launched racist attacks on four congresswomen of color , Senator Lindsey Graham explained , \u201c That \u2019 s just the way he is . It \u2019 s more narcissism than anything else. \u201d So , too , do skeptics of assigning a clinical diagnosis . \u201c No one is denying , \u201d Frances told Rolling Stone , \u201c that he is as narcissistic an individual as one is ever likely to encounter. \u201d The president \u2019 s exceptional narcissism is his defining characteristic\u2014and understanding that is crucial to evaluating his fitness for office . Read more : Is something neurologically wrong with Donald Trump ? The DSM-5 describes its conception of pathological narcissism this way : \u201c The essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity , need for admiration , and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. \u201d The manual sets out nine diagnostic criteria that are indicative of the disorder , but only five of the nine need be present for a diagnosis of NPD to be made . Here are the nine : 1 . Has a grandiose sense of self-importance ( e.g. , exaggerates achievements and talents , expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements ) . 2 . Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success , power , brilliance , beauty , or ideal love . 3 . Believes that he or she is \u201c special \u201d and unique and can only be understood by , or should associate with , other special or high-status people ( or institutions ) . 4 . Requires excessive admiration . 5 . Has a sense of entitlement ( i.e. , unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations ) . 6 . Is interpersonally exploitative ( i.e. , takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends ) 7 . Lacks empathy : is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others . 8 . Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her . 9 . Shows arrogant , haughty behaviors or attitudes . These criteria are accompanied by explanatory notes that seem relevant here : \u201c Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very sensitive to \u2018 injury \u2019 from criticism or defeat. \u201d And \u201c criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated , degraded , hollow and empty . They may react with disdain , rage , or defiant counterattack. \u201d The manual warns , moreover , that \u201c interpersonal relations are typically impaired because of problems derived from entitlement , the need for admiration , and the relative disregard for the sensitivities of others. \u201d And , the DSM-5 adds , \u201c though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high achievement , performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat . \u201d\nFinally , ( 7 ) Lacks empathy : is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others ? One of the most striking aspects of Trump \u2019 s personality is his utter and complete lack of empathy . By empathy , psychologists and psychiatrists mean the ability to understand or relate to what someone else is experiencing\u2014the capacity to envision someone else \u2019 s feelings , perceptions , and thoughts . The notorious lawyer and fixer Roy Cohn , who once counseled Trump , said that \u201c Donald pisses ice water , \u201d and indeed , examples of Trump \u2019 s utter lack of normal human empathy abound . Trump himself has told the story of a charity ball\u2014an \u201c incredible ball \u201d \u2014he once held at Mar-a-Lago for the Red Cross . \u201c So what happens is , this guy falls off right on his face , hits his head , and I thought he died \u2026 His wife is screaming\u2014she \u2019 s sitting right next to him , and she \u2019 s screaming. \u201d By his own account , Trump \u2019 s concern wasn \u2019 t the poor man \u2019 s well-being or his wife \u2019 s . It was the bloody mess on his expensive floor . \u201c You know , beautiful marble floor , didn \u2019 t look like it . It changed color . Became very red \u2026 I said , \u2018 Oh , my God , that \u2019 s disgusting , \u2019 and I turned away . I couldn \u2019 t , you know , he was right in front of me and I turned away. \u201d Trump describes himself as saying , after the injured man was hauled away on a makeshift stretcher , \u201c \u2018 Get that blood cleaned up ! It \u2019 s disgusting ! \u2019 The next day , I forgot to call [ the man ] to say is he okay \u2026 It \u2019 s just not my thing . \u201d\nAnd then there was 9/11 . Trump gave an extraordinary call-in interview to a metropolitan\u2013New York television station just hours after the Twin Towers collapsed . He was asked whether one of his downtown buildings , 40 Wall Street , had suffered any damage . Trump \u2019 s immediate response was to brag about the building \u2019 s brand-new ranking among New York skyscrapers : \u201c 40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan , and it was actually , before the World Trade Center , was the tallest\u2014and then when they built the World Trade Center , it became known as the second-tallest . And now it \u2019 s the tallest. \u201d ( This wasn \u2019 t even true\u2014a building a block away from Trump \u2019 s , 70 Pine Street , was a little taller . ) That human empathy isn \u2019 t Trump \u2019 s thing has been demonstrated time and again during his presidency as well . In October 2017 , he reportedly told the widow of a serviceman killed in action \u201c something to the effect that \u2018 he knew what he was getting into when he signed up , but I guess it hurts anyway. \u2019 \u201d ( Trump later claimed that this account was \u201c fabricated \u2026 Sad ! \u201d and that \u201c I have proof , \u201d but of course he never produced any . ) On a less macabre note , on Christmas Eve last year , Trump took calls on NORAD \u2019 s Santa Tracker phone line , which children call to find out where Santa Claus is as he makes his rounds . Trump asked a 7-year-old girl from South Carolina : \u201c Are you still a believer in Santa ? Because at 7 , it \u2019 s marginal , right ? \u201d\nAccording to Woodward \u2019 s Fear , when Trump \u2019 s first chief of staff , Reince Priebus , resigned , he found out about his replacement when he saw a tweet from Trump saying that he had appointed John Kelly as the new chief of staff\u2014moments after Priebus and Trump had spoken about waiting to announce the news . Kelly was appalled , and that night apologetically told Priebus , \u201c I \u2019 d never do this to you . I \u2019 d never been offered this job until the tweet came out . I would have told you. \u201d His predecessor , though , wasn \u2019 t surprised . \u201c It made no sense , Priebus realized , unless you understood \u2026 \u2018 The president has zero psychological ability to recognize empathy or pity in any way. \u2019 \u201d Priebus apparently isn \u2019 t the only White House staffer to have learned this ; in February 2018 , when Trump met with survivors of the Parkland , Florida , school shooting and their loved ones , his communications aide actually gave him a note card that made clear that \u201c the president needed to be reminded to show compassion and understanding to traumatized survivors , \u201d as The New York Times put it . The empathy cheat sheet contained a reminder to say such things as \u201c I hear you. \u201d One aide to President Obama told the Times that had she and her colleagues given their boss such a reminder card , \u201c he would have looked at us like we were crazy people. \u201d Most recently , in July of this year , in a stunning scene captured on video , Trump met in the Oval Office with the human-rights activist Nadia Murad , a Yazidi Iraqi who had been captured , raped , and tortured by the Islamic State , and had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 for speaking out about the plight of the Yazidis and other victims of genocide and religious persecution . Her voice breaking , she implored the president of the United States to help her people return safely to Iraq . Trump could barely look her in the eye . She told him that ISIS had murdered her mother and six brothers . Trump , apparently not paying much attention , asked , \u201c Where are they now ? \u201d \u201c They killed them , \u201d she said once again . \u201c They are in the mass grave in Sinjar , and I \u2019 m still fighting just to live in safety. \u201d Trump , who has publicly said that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize , seemed interested in the conversation only at the end , when he asked Murad about why she won the prize .\nAnother equally unforgettable video documents Trump visiting Puerto Rico shortly after Hurricane Maria , tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of victims . He later responded vindictively to charges that his administration hadn \u2019 t done enough to help the island , prompting the mayor of San Juan to observe that Trump had \u201c augmented \u201d Puerto Rico \u2019 s \u201c devastating human crisis \u2026 because he made it about himself , not about saving our lives , \u201d and because \u201c when expected to show empathy he showed disdain and lack of respect. \u201d In October 2018 , a gunman burst into Shabbat morning services at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh and sprayed worshippers with semiautomatic-rifle and pistol fire . Eleven people died . Three days later , the president and first lady visited the community , and the day after that , the first thing Trump tweeted about the visit was this : \u201c Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh . The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day . We were treated so warmly . Small protest was not seen by us , staged far away . The Fake News stories were just the opposite\u2014Disgraceful ! \u201d Similarly , after gunmen killed dozens in the span of a single August weekend in Dayton , Ohio , and El Paso , Texas , Trump went on a one-day sympathy tour that was marked by attacks on his hosts and on political enemies , and an obsessive focus on himself .

        "content_original": "\n\n\n\nLink Copied\n\n\n\nOn a third-down play last season, the Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith stood in shotgun formation, five yards behind the line of scrimmage. As he called his signals, a Houston Texans cornerback, Kareem Jackson, suddenly sprinted forward from a position four yards behind the defensive line. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Jackson\u2019s timing was perfect. The ball was snapped. The Texans\u2019 left defensive end, J.J. Watt, sprinted to the outside, taking the Redskins\u2019 right tackle with him. The defensive tackle on Watt\u2019s right rushed to the inside, taking the offensive right guard with him. The result was a huge gap in the Redskins\u2019 line, through which Jackson could run unblocked. He quickly sacked Smith, for a loss of 13 yards. Special-teams players began taking the field for the punt. But Smith didn\u2019t get up. He rolled flat onto his back, pulled off his helmet, and covered his face with his hands. He was clearly in excruciating pain. The slow-motion replay immediately showed the television audience why: As Smith was tackled, his right leg had buckled sharply above the ankle, with his foot rotating significantly away from any direction in which a human foot ought to point. The play-by-play announcer Greg Gumbel said grimly, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back,\u201d and the network abruptly cut to a break. There was nothing more to say.\n\nEven without the benefit of medical training, and even without conducting a physical examination, viewers knew what had happened. They may not have known what the bones were called or what treatment would be required, but they knew more than enough, and they knew what really mattered: Smith had broken his leg, very badly. They knew that even if they were not orthopedists, did not have a medical degree, and had never cracked open a copy of Gray\u2019s Anatomy. They could tell\u2014they were certain\u2014something was seriously wrong. And so it is, or ought to be, with Donald Trump. You don\u2019t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, and you don\u2019t need to be a mental-health professional to see that something\u2019s very seriously off with Trump\u2014particularly after nearly three years of watching his erratic and abnormal behavior in the White House. Questions about Trump\u2019s psychological stability have mounted throughout his presidency. But those questions have been coming even more frequently amid a recent escalation in Trump\u2019s bizarre behavior, as the pressures of his upcoming reelection campaign, a possibly deteriorating economy, and now a full-blown impeachment inquiry have mounted. And the questioners have included those who have worked most closely with him. No president in recent memory\u2014and likely no president ever\u2014has prompted more discussion about his mental stability and connection with reality. Trump\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly is said to have described him as \u201cunhinged,\u201d and \u201coff the rails,\u201d and to have called the White House \u201cCrazytown\u201d because of Trump\u2019s unbalanced state. Trump\u2019s former deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, once reportedly discussed recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, the Constitution\u2019s provision addressing presidential disability, including mental disability.\n\nRead more: Donald Trump\u2019s 50 most unthinkable moments Rosenstein denies that claim, but it is not the only such account. A senior administration official, writing anonymously in The New York Times last September, described how, \u201cgiven the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment\u201d\u2014but \u201cno one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis.\u201d And NBC News last week quoted someone familiar with current discussions in the White House warning that there is \u201cincreasing wariness that, as this impeachment inquiry drags out, the likelihood increases that the president could respond erratically and become \u2018unmanageable.\u2019\u201d In September, a former White House official offered a similar assessment to a Business Insider reporter: \u201cNo one knows what to expect from him anymore,\u201d because \u201chis mood changes from one minute to the next based on some headline or tweet, and the next thing you know his entire schedule gets tossed out the window. He\u2019s losing his shit.\u201d Even a major investment bank has gotten into the mix, albeit in a roundabout way: JPMorgan Chase has created a \u201cVolfefe Index\u201d\u2014named after Trump\u2019s bizarre May 2017 \u201ccovfefe\u201d tweet\u2014designed to quantify the effect that Trump\u2019s impulsive tweets have on interest-rate volatility. The bank\u2019s press release understatedly observed that its \u201cvolatility fair value model\u201d shows that \u201cthe president\u2019s remarks on this social media platform [have] played a statistically significant role in elevating implied volatility.\u201d\n\nThe president isn\u2019t simply volatile and erratic, however\u2014he\u2019s also incapable of consistently telling the truth. Those who work closely with him, and who aren\u2019t in denial, must deal with Trump\u2019s lying about serious matters virtually every day. But as one former official put it, they \u201care used to the president saying things that aren\u2019t true,\u201d and have inured themselves to it. Trump\u2019s own former communications director Anthony Scaramucci has on multiple occasions described Trump as a liar, once saying, \u201cWe \u2026 know he\u2019s telling lies,\u201d so \u201cif you want me to say he\u2019s a liar, I\u2019m happy to say he\u2019s a liar.\u201d He went on to address Trump directly: \u201cYou should probably dial down the lying because you don\u2019t need to \u2026 So dial that down, and you\u2019ll be doing a lot better.\u201d That was good advice, but clearly wishful thinking. Trump simply can\u2019t dial down the lying, or turn it off\u2014even, his own attorneys suggest, when false statements may be punished as crimes. A lawyer who has represented him in business disputes once told me that Trump couldn\u2019t sensibly be allowed to speak with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, because Trump would \u201clie his ass off\u201d\u2014in effect, that Trump simply wasn\u2019t capable of telling the truth, about anything, and that if he ever spoke to a prosecutor, he\u2019d talk himself into jail. Trump\u2019s lawyers in the Russia investigation clearly agreed: As Bob Woodward recounts at length in his book Fear, members of Trump\u2019s criminal-defense team fought both Trump and Mueller tooth and nail to keep Trump from being interviewed by the Office of Special Counsel. A practice testimonial session ended with Trump spouting wild, baseless assertions in a rage. Woodward quotes Trump\u2019s outside counsel John Dowd as saying that Trump \u201cjust made something up\u201d in response to one question. \u201cThat\u2019s his nature.\u201d Woodward also recounts Dowd\u2019s thinking when he argued to Trump that the president was \u201cnot really capable\u201d of answering Mueller\u2019s questions face to face. Dowd had \u201cto dress it up as much as possible, to say, it\u2019s not your fault \u2026 He could not say what he knew was true: \u2018You\u2019re a fucking liar.\u2019 That was the problem.\u201d (Dowd disputes this account.) Which raises the question: If Trump can\u2019t tell the truth even when it counts most, with legal jeopardy on the line and lawyers there to help prepare him, is he able to apprehend the truth at all?\n\nBehavior like this is unusual, a point that journalists across the political spectrum have made. \u201cThis is not normal,\u201d Megan McArdle wrote in late August. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean that as in, \u2018Trump is violating the shibboleths of the Washington establishment.\u2019 I mean that as in, \u2018This is not normal for a functioning adult.\u2019\u201d James Fallows observed, also in August, that Trump is having \u201cepisodes of what would be called outright lunacy, if they occurred in any other setting,\u201d and that if he \u201cwere in virtually any other position of responsibility, action would already be under way to remove him from that role.\u201d Trump\u2019s erratic behavior has long been the subject of political criticism, late-night-television jokes, and even speculation about whether it\u2019s part of some incomprehensible, multidimensional strategic game. But it\u2019s relevant to whether he\u2019s fit for the office he holds. Simply put, Trump\u2019s ingrained and extreme behavioral characteristics make it impossible for him to carry out the duties of the presidency in the way the Constitution requires. To see why first requires a look at what the Constitution demands of a president, and then an examination of how Trump\u2019s behavioral characteristics preclude his ability to fulfill those demands. The Framers of the Constitution expected the presidency to be occupied by special individuals, selfless people of the highest character and ability. They intended the Electoral College to be a truly deliberative body, not the largely ceremonial institution it has become today. Because the Electoral College, unlike Congress and the state legislatures, wouldn\u2019t be a permanent body, and because it involved diffuse selections made in the various states, they hoped it would help avoid \u201ccabal, intrigue and corruption,\u201d as Alexander Hamilton put it in \u201cFederalist No. 68,\u201d and deter interference from \u201cthese most deadly adversaries of republican government,\u201d especially \u201cfrom the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.\u201d\n\nThough the Constitution\u2019s drafters could hardly have foreseen how the system would evolve, they certainly knew the kind of person they wanted it to produce. \u201cThe process of election affords a moral certainty,\u201d Hamilton wrote, \u201cthat the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\u201d \u201cTalents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity,\u201d might suffice for someone to be elected to the governorship of a state, but not the presidency. Election would \u201crequire other talents, and a different kind of merit,\u201d to gain \u201cthe esteem and confidence of the whole Union,\u201d or enough of it to win the presidency. As a result, there would be \u201ca constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue.\u201d This was the Framers\u2019 goal in designing the system that would make \u201cthe choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided.\u201d Read more: The presidency is the hardest job in the world Hamilton\u2019s use of the word trust in The Federalist Papers to describe the presidency was no accident. The Framers intended that the president \u201cbe like a fiduciary, who must pursue the public interest in good faith republican fashion rather than pursuing his self-interest, and who must diligently and steadily execute Congress\u2019s commands,\u201d as a recent Harvard Law Review article puts it. The concept is akin to the law of private fiduciaries, which governs trustees of trusts and directors and officers of corporations, an area that has been central to my legal practice as a corporate litigator. \u201cIndeed,\u201d as the Harvard Law Review article explains, \u201cone might argue that what presents to us as private fiduciary law today had some of its genesis in the law of public officeholding.\u201d The overarching principle is that a fiduciary\u2014say, the CEO of a corporation\u2014when acting on behalf of a corporation, has to act in the corporation\u2019s best interests. Likewise, a trustee of a trust must use the assets for the benefit of the beneficiary, and not himself (a fundamental rule, incidentally, that Trump apparently couldn\u2019t adhere to with his own charitable foundation).\n\nIn providing for a national chief executive, the Framers incorporated the very similar law of public officeholding into his duties in two places in the Constitution\u2014in Article II, Section 3 (the president \u201cshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u201d), and in Article II, Section 1, Clause 8, which requires the president to \u201csolemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States.\u201d That language\u2014particularly the words faithfully execute\u2014was in 1787 \u201cvery commonly associated with the performance of public and private offices,\u201d the Harvard Law Review article points out, and \u201canyone experienced in law or government\u201d at that time would have recognized what it meant, \u201cbecause it was so basic to \u2026 the law of executive officeholding.\u201d In a nutshell, while carrying out his official duties, a president has to put the country, not himself, first; he must faithfully follow and enforce the law; and he must act with the utmost care in doing all that. But can Trump do all that? Does his personality allow him to? Answering those questions doesn\u2019t require mental-health expertise, nor does it really require a diagnosis. You can make the argument for Trump\u2019s unfitness without assessing his mental health: Like James Fallows, for example, you could just ask whether Trump would have been allowed to retain any other job in light of his bizarre conduct. At the same time, the presence of a mental disorder or disturbance doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to incapacity; to suggest otherwise would unfairly stigmatize tens of millions of Americans. Someone battling a serious psychological ailment can unquestionably function well, and even nobly, in high public office\u2014including as president. The country, in fact, has seen it: Abraham Lincoln endured \u201cno mere case of the blues\u201d; he suffered such \u201cterrible melancholly,\u201d said one of his contemporaries, that \u201che never dare[d] carry a knife in his pocket.\u201d Many historians speculate that he suffered from what we would now diagnose as clinical depression. Yet Lincoln\u2019s mechanisms for coping with his lifelong affliction may have supplied him with the vision, the creativity, and the moral fortitude to save the nation, to achieve for it a new birth of freedom. As a writer in this magazine once put it: Lincoln\u2019s \u201cpolitical vision drew power from personal experience \u2026 Prepared for defeat, and even for humiliation, he insisted on seeing the truth of both his personal circumstances and the national condition. And where the optimists of his time would fail, he would succeed, envisioning and articulating a durable idea of free society.\u201d\n\nMore than a diagnosis, what truly matters, as Lincoln\u2019s case shows, is the president\u2019s behavioral characteristics and personality traits. And understanding how people behave and think is not the sole province of professionals; we all do it every day, with family members, co-workers, and others. Nevertheless, how the mental-health community goes about categorizing those characteristics and traits can provide helpful guidance to laypeople by structuring our thinking about them. Read more: Donald Trump is not well And that\u2019s where the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders comes into play. The DSM, now in its fifth edition, \u201ccontains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria for diagnosing mental disorders,\u201d and serves as the country\u2019s \u201cauthoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders.\u201d What\u2019s useful for nonprofessionals is that, for the most part, it\u2019s written in plain English, and its criteria consist largely of observable behaviors\u2014words and actions. That\u2019s especially true of its criteria for personality disorders\u2014they don\u2019t require a person to lie on a couch and confess his or her innermost thoughts. They turn on how a person behaves in the wild, so to speak. If anything, a patient\u2019s confessions in an office may disadvantage a clinician, because patients can and do conceal from clinicians central aspects of their true selves. If you can observe people going about their everyday business, you\u2019ll know a lot more about how they act and behave.\n\nAnd Donald Trump, as president of the United States, is probably the most observable and observed person in the world. I\u2019ve personally met and spoken with him only a few times, but anyone who knows him will tell you that Trump, in a way, has no facade: What you see of him publicly is what you get all the time, although you may get more of it in private. Any intelligent person who watches Trump closely on television, and pays careful attention to his words on Twitter and in the press, should be able to tell you as much about his behavior as a mental-health professional could. One scholarly paper has suggested that accounts of a person\u2019s behavior from laypeople who observe him might be more accurate than information from a clinical interview, and that this is especially true when considering two personality disorders in particular\u2014what the DSM calls narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. These two disorders just happen to be the ones that have most commonly been ascribed to Trump by mental-health professionals over the past four years. Of these two disorders, the more commonly discussed when it comes to Trump is narcissistic personality disorder, or NPD\u2014pathological narcissism. It\u2019s also more important in considering Trump\u2019s fitness for office, because it touches directly upon whether Trump has the capacity to put anyone\u2019s interests\u2014including the country\u2019s and the Constitution\u2019s\u2014above his own.\n\nNarcissus, the Greek mythological figure, was a boy who fell so in love with his own reflection in a pool of water that, according to one version of the story, he jumped in and drowned. Psychiatrists and psychologists now use the term narcissism to describe feelings of self-importance and self-love. As Craig Malkin, a clinical psychologist who has written extensively on the subject, has explained, narcissism is a trait that, to some extent, all human beings have: \u201cthe drive to feel special, to stand out from \u2026 other[s] \u2026 to feel exceptional or unique.\u201d A certain amount of narcissism is healthy, and helpful\u2014it brings with it confidence, optimism, and boldness. Someone with more than an average amount of narcissism may be called a narcissist. Many politicians, and many celebrities, could be considered narcissists; presidents seem especially likely to \u201crank high in extroverted narcissism,\u201d Malkin writes, although they have varied greatly in the degree of their narcissism. But extreme narcissism can be pathological, an illness\u2014and potentially a danger, as it was for Narcissus. \u201cPathological narcissism begins when people become so addicted to feeling special that, just like with any drug, they\u2019ll do anything to get their \u2018high,\u2019 including lie, steal, cheat, betray, and even hurt those closest to them,\u201d Malkin says. The \u201cfundamental life goal\u201d of an extreme narcissist \u201cis to promote the greatness of the self, for all to see,\u201d the psychologist Dan P. McAdams wrote in The Atlantic. To many mental-health professionals, Donald Trump provides a perfect example of such extreme, pathological narcissism: One clinical psychologist told Vanity Fair that he considers Trump such a \u201cclassic\u201d pathological narcissist that he is actually \u201carchiving video clips of him to use in workshops because there\u2019s no better example\u201d of the characteristics of the disorder he displays. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d this clinician explained, \u201cI would have had to hire actors and write vignettes. He\u2019s like a dream come true.\u201d Another clinical psychologist said that Trump displays \u201ctextbook narcissistic personality disorder.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees that Trump meets the diagnostic criteria for NPD. Allen Frances, a psychiatrist who helped write the disorder\u2019s entry in the DSM, has argued that a mental \u201cdisturbance\u201d becomes a \u201cdisorder\u201d only when, as the DSM puts it, the affliction \u201ccauses clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\u201d The idea behind this threshold is to separate \u201cmild forms\u201d of problems from pathological ones, \u201cin the absence of clear biological markers or clinically useful measurements of severity for many mental disorders.\u201d In Frances\u2019s view, that dividing line disqualifies Trump from having a disorder, particularly NPD. Trump \u201cmay be a world-class narcissist,\u201d he has written, \u201cbut this doesn\u2019t make him mentally ill, because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder. Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy.\u201d But from the perspective of the public at large, the debate over whether Trump meets the clinical diagnostic criteria for NPD\u2014or whether psychiatrists can and should answer that question without directly examining him\u2014is beside the point. The goal of a diagnosis is to help a clinician guide treatment. The question facing the public is very different: Does the president of the United States exhibit a consistent pattern of behavior that suggests he is incapable of properly discharging the duties of his office?\n\nEven Trump\u2019s own allies recognize the degree of his narcissism. When he launched racist attacks on four congresswomen of color, Senator Lindsey Graham explained, \u201cThat\u2019s just the way he is. It\u2019s more narcissism than anything else.\u201d So, too, do skeptics of assigning a clinical diagnosis. \u201cNo one is denying,\u201d Frances told Rolling Stone, \u201cthat he is as narcissistic an individual as one is ever likely to encounter.\u201d The president\u2019s exceptional narcissism is his defining characteristic\u2014and understanding that is crucial to evaluating his fitness for office. Read more: Is something neurologically wrong with Donald Trump? The DSM-5 describes its conception of pathological narcissism this way: \u201cThe essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.\u201d The manual sets out nine diagnostic criteria that are indicative of the disorder, but only five of the nine need be present for a diagnosis of NPD to be made. Here are the nine: 1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements). 2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. 3. Believes that he or she is \u201cspecial\u201d and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions). 4. Requires excessive admiration. 5. Has a sense of entitlement (i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations). 6. Is interpersonally exploitative (i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends) 7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others. 8. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her. 9. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes. These criteria are accompanied by explanatory notes that seem relevant here: \u201cVulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very sensitive to \u2018injury\u2019 from criticism or defeat.\u201d And \u201ccriticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack.\u201d The manual warns, moreover, that \u201cinterpersonal relations are typically impaired because of problems derived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative disregard for the sensitivities of others.\u201d And, the DSM-5 adds, \u201cthough overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high achievement, performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat.\u201d\n\nFinally, (7) Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others? One of the most striking aspects of Trump\u2019s personality is his utter and complete lack of empathy. By empathy, psychologists and psychiatrists mean the ability to understand or relate to what someone else is experiencing\u2014the capacity to envision someone else\u2019s feelings, perceptions, and thoughts. The notorious lawyer and fixer Roy Cohn, who once counseled Trump, said that \u201cDonald pisses ice water,\u201d and indeed, examples of Trump\u2019s utter lack of normal human empathy abound. Trump himself has told the story of a charity ball\u2014an \u201cincredible ball\u201d\u2014he once held at Mar-a-Lago for the Red Cross. \u201cSo what happens is, this guy falls off right on his face, hits his head, and I thought he died \u2026 His wife is screaming\u2014she\u2019s sitting right next to him, and she\u2019s screaming.\u201d By his own account, Trump\u2019s concern wasn\u2019t the poor man\u2019s well-being or his wife\u2019s. It was the bloody mess on his expensive floor. \u201cYou know, beautiful marble floor, didn\u2019t look like it. It changed color. Became very red \u2026 I said, \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019 and I turned away. I couldn\u2019t, you know, he was right in front of me and I turned away.\u201d Trump describes himself as saying, after the injured man was hauled away on a makeshift stretcher, \u201c\u2018Get that blood cleaned up! It\u2019s disgusting!\u2019 The next day, I forgot to call [the man] to say is he okay \u2026 It\u2019s just not my thing.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was 9/11. Trump gave an extraordinary call-in interview to a metropolitan\u2013New York television station just hours after the Twin Towers collapsed. He was asked whether one of his downtown buildings, 40 Wall Street, had suffered any damage. Trump\u2019s immediate response was to brag about the building\u2019s brand-new ranking among New York skyscrapers: \u201c40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest\u2014and then when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest. And now it\u2019s the tallest.\u201d (This wasn\u2019t even true\u2014a building a block away from Trump\u2019s, 70 Pine Street, was a little taller.) That human empathy isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s thing has been demonstrated time and again during his presidency as well. In October 2017, he reportedly told the widow of a serviceman killed in action \u201csomething to the effect that \u2018he knew what he was getting into when he signed up, but I guess it hurts anyway.\u2019\u201d (Trump later claimed that this account was \u201cfabricated \u2026 Sad!\u201d and that \u201cI have proof,\u201d but of course he never produced any.) On a less macabre note, on Christmas Eve last year, Trump took calls on NORAD\u2019s Santa Tracker phone line, which children call to find out where Santa Claus is as he makes his rounds. Trump asked a 7-year-old girl from South Carolina: \u201cAre you still a believer in Santa? Because at 7, it\u2019s marginal, right?\u201d\n\nAccording to Woodward\u2019s Fear, when Trump\u2019s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, resigned, he found out about his replacement when he saw a tweet from Trump saying that he had appointed John Kelly as the new chief of staff\u2014moments after Priebus and Trump had spoken about waiting to announce the news. Kelly was appalled, and that night apologetically told Priebus, \u201cI\u2019d never do this to you. I\u2019d never been offered this job until the tweet came out. I would have told you.\u201d His predecessor, though, wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cIt made no sense, Priebus realized, unless you understood \u2026 \u2018The president has zero psychological ability to recognize empathy or pity in any way.\u2019\u201d Priebus apparently isn\u2019t the only White House staffer to have learned this; in February 2018, when Trump met with survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and their loved ones, his communications aide actually gave him a note card that made clear that \u201cthe president needed to be reminded to show compassion and understanding to traumatized survivors,\u201d as The New York Times put it. The empathy cheat sheet contained a reminder to say such things as \u201cI hear you.\u201d One aide to President Obama told the Times that had she and her colleagues given their boss such a reminder card, \u201che would have looked at us like we were crazy people.\u201d Most recently, in July of this year, in a stunning scene captured on video, Trump met in the Oval Office with the human-rights activist Nadia Murad, a Yazidi Iraqi who had been captured, raped, and tortured by the Islamic State, and had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 for speaking out about the plight of the Yazidis and other victims of genocide and religious persecution. Her voice breaking, she implored the president of the United States to help her people return safely to Iraq. Trump could barely look her in the eye. She told him that ISIS had murdered her mother and six brothers. Trump, apparently not paying much attention, asked, \u201cWhere are they now?\u201d \u201cThey killed them,\u201d she said once again. \u201cThey are in the mass grave in Sinjar, and I\u2019m still fighting just to live in safety.\u201d Trump, who has publicly said that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, seemed interested in the conversation only at the end, when he asked Murad about why she won the prize.\n\nAnother equally unforgettable video documents Trump visiting Puerto Rico shortly after Hurricane Maria, tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of victims. He later responded vindictively to charges that his administration hadn\u2019t done enough to help the island, prompting the mayor of San Juan to observe that Trump had \u201caugmented\u201d Puerto Rico\u2019s \u201cdevastating human crisis \u2026 because he made it about himself, not about saving our lives,\u201d and because \u201cwhen expected to show empathy he showed disdain and lack of respect.\u201d In October 2018, a gunman burst into Shabbat morning services at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh and sprayed worshippers with semiautomatic-rifle and pistol fire. Eleven people died. Three days later, the president and first lady visited the community, and the day after that, the first thing Trump tweeted about the visit was this: \u201cMelania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite\u2014Disgraceful!\u201d Similarly, after gunmen killed dozens in the span of a single August weekend in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, Trump went on a one-day sympathy tour that was marked by attacks on his hosts and on political enemies, and an obsessive focus on himself.

        "content_original": "Story highlights Establishment Republicans are fighting back more strongly against challenges from the right\n\nWith a number of vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, GOP thinks it can win control\n\nNorth Carolina primary seen as a key test of establishment-vs.-tea party scenario\n\nVoters in North Carolina, Indiana and Ohio on Tuesday kick off five straight weeks of primary contests that could give us a clearer indication of whether establishment Republicans have the upper hand against the tea party movement for control of the party.\n\nThe results could back up recent tough talk from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who predicted big wins for incumbents facing primary challenges from the right, saying, \"I think we are going to crush them everywhere.\"\n\nAnd they may have a major impact in determining whether Republicans retake the majority in the Senate.\n\nSince the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the GOP and hurt the party's chances of winning back the Senate from Democrats in the past two election cycles. Candidates backed by the tea party movement and other grass-roots conservatives effectively cost the GOP five winnable Senate elections the last two cycles in Nevada, Delaware, Colorado, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nTwo months ago, McConnell, whom the right sees as part of the problem in Washington, told The New York Times that when it came to tea party challenges, \"I don't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Poll: Skeptical of Obama, Economy Replay More Videos ...

There is more organization and involvement from outside groups in some of these primaries. I think in the past, it was too often an incumbent running against an anti-establishment challenger and a host of outside groups,\" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report.\n\nTea party 'changed the narrative'\n\nBut leaders of the 5-year-old grass-roots movement disagree with the suggestion that the tide has turned against them.\n\n\"I think the establishment is taking its victory lap a little early,\" said Kevin Broughton, spokesman for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, who added that \"There are more wins to come.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED The 'Inside Politics' Forecast: May 4 Replay More Videos ...

Now, both sides of the aisle express concern about our ballooning national debt,\" said Kremer, who just stepped down as chairwoman of the Tea Party Express and is now helping Matt Bevin in his bid to unseat McConnell in Kentucky.\n\nVulnerable Democrats put control of the Senate in play\n\nIn North Carolina, first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is vulnerable. Flipping her seat and five others held by Democrats would give Republicans control of the Senate.\n\nThe Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in November, with half of those Democratic seats in red or purple states, such as North Carolina, which will be the first indicator whether things will be different this time. The establishment is rallying around state House Speaker Thom Tillis, the front-runner in a multi-candidate field for the Republican Senate nomination. Tillis was endorsed Monday by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and late last week by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who's seriously considering a bid for president in 2016. The most recent polling indicates Tillis hovering right around the 40% mark, which he needs to crack in order to avoid a July runoff.\n\nThe two most serious challengers are Greg Brannon, a tea party activist and first-time candidate who enjoys the support of some major tea party groups, as well as other influential conservative organizations and endorsements from the likes of Sens.

Harris enjoys the support of a high-profile fellow pastor: former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a 2008 Republican presidential candidate who may run again for the White House in 2016.\n\nWhile none of the candidates, including Tillis, have raised or spent a lot of money in the campaign, the state House speaker enjoys the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads, two outside groups that combined have spent millions this cycle to run ads backing Tillis and other establishment picks.\n\nLast week, in what was described as a major buy, the pro-business Chamber launched a television commercial that described Tillis as \"a bold conservative who balanced our budget and reduced regulations.

        "content": "Black voters are getting a significant amount of attention these days .\nIn many ways , it \u2019 s a welcome development : After years of helping Democrats secure crucial election victories , black voters are being recognized as an influential voting bloc . This was perhaps most notable in 2008 and 2012 , where their increased turnout helped deliver the White House to Barack Obama , the nation \u2019 s first black president .\nBut black voters had been wielding their power even before this , in situations like the 1984 Democratic primary , where the support of black voters single-handedly turned Jesse Jackson into a contender , or the 1992 primaries , which saw black voters help Bill Clinton secure the party \u2019 s nomination . Since the 1990s , black voters have largely backed the candidate that has gone on to win the Democratic nomination , cementing the group \u2019 s status as powerful players in presidential politics .\nBut that does not mean black voters are a monolith .\nNote that Carter , Clinton , and Obama all won without winning white folks .\nMoral : follow the votes and invest in communities of color pic.twitter.com/cA7JMr1J34 \u2014 Leah D. Daughtry ( @ LeahDaughtry ) September 15 , 2019\nIn other words , there isn \u2019 t a single black vote . There are many . A seemingly monolithic black electorate often coalesces only after individual black voters make decisions based on a nuanced set of political calculations .\n\u201c Black voters today are behaving in a very smart and strategic way that they \u2019 ve always behaved in , but no one ever really lets us be smart , \u201d says Keneshia Grant , an assistant professor of political science at Howard University . \u201c Black voters get viewed as sheep who are being told where to go , and I think that \u2019 s wrong and the data shows that this is wrong . \u201d\nBlack voters , much like other voters in the electorate , have varying ideologies . Some are more conservative than others . Some are far more progressive . And there other splits as well , along lines of age , gender , income , and geography . This has always been the case , and yet , it is rarely discussed in mainstream political conversations about courting black voters .\nIt \u2019 s an important reality , though , and could become particularly significant in the current election cycle . While prior elections have shown a united black vote , over the past few months black political journalists , strategists , and academics have made the argument that the 2020 race is incredibly fluid . With so many candidates in play , black voters could potentially spread their vote across multiple candidates in early-primary and caucus states , or push their support to a different candidate than former Vice President Joe Biden , the current frontrunner .\nIn fact , a lot of black voters ( like voters more broadly ) have said they are open to switching to a different candidate or are undecided about who to support , and the next few months of campaigning could be especially important for any campaign hoping to attract as many black voters as possible . Candidates need to do more than black outreach , though : They also must show a clear understanding of black voters , their needs , and their concerns .\n\u201c Based on the different demographics of the black electorate , you do have some people making different choices about who their top candidate is or who their second choice is , \u201d Adrianne Shropshire , the executive director of BlackPAC , a group focused on increasing black political power , tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c That is what is most distinctive about the black vote now . It isn \u2019 t exactly going en masse to one place . \u201d\nWhat black primary voting has looked like in prior elections\nTo understand what \u2019 s at stake when it comes to winning black voters in 2020 , it \u2019 s helpful to understand how this group has voted in previous elections . A 2019 analysis from NBC News offers one of the most comprehensive histories of black voting behavior for the nine competitive national Democratic primaries that have occurred since exit polling began in the 1970s .\nThat project found that black voters have become an increasingly important share of the Democratic Party , going from a bloc that drew national attention as it flexed its muscle during the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson \u2014 forcing concessions and promises from the Democratic Party in the process \u2014 to a group that 20 years later helped Barack Obama gain the electoral advantage necessary for him to clinch the 2008 Democratic nomination .\nIn what is perhaps more predicative to the 2020 election , though , the NBC News project showed that black voters have become powerful because of how they vote , with this demographic often rallying around a single candidate as the primary voting continues \u2014 but not always before . Securing a high margin of votes from black people can make it easier for candidates to win decisive victories in states with high black populations , helping to tip the nomination toward them .\nTake , for example , the aforementioned 2008 Democratic presidential primary . While then-Sen. Barack Obama \u2019 s success over Hillary Clinton is often remembered \u2014 as is the fact that black voters began to overwhelmingly support him after the Iowa Caucus \u2014 what often isn \u2019 t as readily acknowledged is that for months before this , there had been a noticeable split in the black voters backing him and the black voters who weren \u2019 t . Early in the contest , Obama was supported mainly by younger black voters , as older voters and many black politicians backed Clinton , pointing to her established history in the black community , her work during her husband \u2019 s presidential administration , and for some , their belief that Obama wasn \u2019 t well-known enough to be electable .\nBut when a majority of this group flipped to Obama in 2008 , they helped him advance further , propelling him to a win in South Carolina weeks later . Obama also won every primary held in a state where blacks were more than 20 percent of the population , and in some states , he managed to win over as much as 90 percent of black voters .\nThat primary offers a lot of lessons . For one , it shows that the margin of victory for a candidate among black voters matters almost as much as the victory itself , meaning that it \u2019 s in a candidate \u2019 s best interest to push their support among black voters as high as it can possibly go . The 2008 primary also provides one example of how black voting power has worked in recent elections : showing how a presumed frontrunner who was banking on black support ( Clinton ) , and actually did have a lot of support from specific groups of black voters and the black political class , saw much of her lead evaporate after a different candidate proved they could also get votes from different portions of the electorate .\nAnd after the primary , the 2008 general election also showed that black voters responded well to continued engagement and outreach later in the election cycle , with their turnout reaching historic levels in 2008 and 2012 .\nBut if 2008 showed how black voters could help turn a candidate from an underdog to a presidential nominee , eight years later , in 2016 , black voters showed how withholding their votes could keep a candidate \u2019 s chances as a longshot .\nIn this cycle , Clinton , again the presumed frontrunner , faced off against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . However , this time , Clinton \u2019 s lead with black voters held , helping her win the nomination . But there were fractures among black voters that were often overlooked or dismissed in discussions of the contest : a large chunk of young black voters , much as they had for Obama , broke for Sanders early and stayed with him through the primary , and also played a key role in Sanders winning in Michigan . But what differed this time is the fact that Sanders was unable to pull many older black voters to his side .\nThe story of black voters in 2016 has largely focused less on the primary than on the general election , with news reports in the immediate days after the November election focusing on how black turnout declined compared to 2008 and 2012 . But when it comes to actually understanding differences among black voters , the 2016 primary matters : It shows some important differences among black voters that have only grown more pronounced in 2019 .\nIn 2016 , the differences between Sanders and Clinton supporters weren \u2019 t just a matter of a younger voter/older voter split or a geographic one . Clinton also did better with black women than black men and attracted more support from more moderate black voters looking to maintain the gains of the Obama era rather than adopt an agenda of radical change . On the other hand , she also got less support from young black progressives looking for a jolt to the system , many of whom criticized Clinton \u2019 s record on issues like racial justice .\nThis reveals some important divides in how black voters settled on her candidacy and shows that while the majority of black voters may have backed Clinton , there were many different reasons and motivations behind why they did ( and in some cases did not ) . More importantly , the way these divides intersect and diverge is critical to understanding the behavior of the black electorate now . Elections may have shown that black voters often become an electoral monolith , but they are far from being an ideological one .\n\u201c Black America is no more monolithic than any other group , \u201d Theodore Johnson , a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies African American politics and black voter behavior patterns , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Whatever the spectrum is for ideology and politics , black voters are scattered all along that spectrum just like any other racial group . \u201d\nBiden is currently the leading choice for black voters \u2014 but that lead isn \u2019 t indestructible\nIn the 2020 election cycle , it \u2019 s likely that we will see high black turnout and enthusiasm . Many black voters will mobilize for a number of reasons : a desire to oust Trump , an interest in a new anti-racist policy agenda in the White House , and a hope for change on the issues affecting their daily lives and communities .\n\u201c Black voters want to back the candidate who is going to win , and in the Trump era , that also means backing the person most likely to push Trump out of office , \u201d Johnson says .\nWith the start of primary voting still a few months away , we can \u2019 t definitively say who will benefit from this . Currently , polling shows former Vice President Joe Biden having a large lead among black voters , beating his competitors by double digits with this group . Biden is banking on black support , and his team has increasingly indicated that it sees the majority-black South Carolina primary , which will happen on February 29 , as critical to his chances of winning the nomination . According to an October poll from Winthrop University , for now , his plan is solid : 46 percent of black voters in South Carolina say he \u2019 s the most likely candidate to get their support .\n\u201c The black folks support Biden , next to Jesus right now , that \u2019 s where he is , \u201d Dot Scott , head of Charleston \u2019 s NAACP chapter , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Li Zhou recently , pointing to Biden \u2019 s deep ties to black communities in the state and his role as Barack Obama \u2019 s vice president .\nWhen the primary began earlier this year , some experts thought things would turn out differently . \u201c I went into [ this election cycle ] thinking that this would be a cycle where we would see black voters \u2019 political diversity at play , \u201d Johnson told me . He noted that last winter and spring , the field seemed to be wide open and full of relatively unknown candidates of different ages , racial backgrounds , genders , and political ideologies , potentially leaving black voters to spread out across multiple candidates .\nBut that changed once a particular candidate entered the race . \u201c As soon as Biden jumped in , it sort of ruined the calculus , \u201d Johnson says of the former vice president \u2019 s leap to the top of the polls this spring , a position he has maintained ( with some stumbles ) in the months since . \u201c He \u2019 s such a known quantity . \u201d\nSomebody got ta say it : The overwhelming support for Joe Biden is based purely off fear that white folks won \u2019 t vote for anyone else on that stage . Because there is no way you see him in these moments and think he \u2019 s actually the best candidate . \u2014 Jemele Hill ( @ jemelehill ) September 13 , 2019\nAs I wrote in June , there are a lot of reasons why some black voters started lining up behind Biden early . Some black voters say their support makes sense given their pragmatism , and they believe that Biden is the only \u201c electable \u201d candidate who will be supported by more moderate white voters and some conservatives unwilling to vote for Trump . Other black voters place a lot of importance on Biden \u2019 s role as Obama \u2019 s vice president and support him due to that history . And some black voters believe that Biden is actually the best policy choice , that his incremental approach to civil rights and call for a return to \u201c normalcy \u201d is the right one in this particular moment . There are voters who believe more than one of these things and others who believe all three .\n\u201c There is an aspect of this that is about who can put up the fight that is going to be required to take Trump down , \u201d Shropshire tells me . \u201c And some black people know that part of Biden \u2019 s narrative is that he \u2019 s a fighter and that he fought for Obama . And that is not insignificant . \u201d\nSome of these arguments have been pushed frequently by the Biden campaign , which has repeatedly emphasized the former vice president \u2019 s connection to black voters , particularly the older , more moderate voters who regularly turn out for elections . \u201c They have a sense of who my character is and who I am \u2014 warts and all , \u201d Biden told a group of black reporters in August .\nPolling also shows that this group is supporting Biden strongly . An October poll from Morning Consult , for example , found that Biden has 48 percent support among black voters aged 45-54 , 53 percent among those aged 55-64 , and 56 percent among those 65 and older .\nBiden is also quick to remind voters of his role in the Obama administration , which also likely plays a role in these numbers . \u201c The Biden campaign has been masterful at messaging Biden as the \u2018 great friend and ally of Barack Obama , \u2019 who Obama loved so much and chose as his vice president , \u201d Grant , the Howard University professor , says . \u201c To the extent that black people are saying that they support Joe Biden , I think that they are supporting who they think has the highest likelihood of being competitive in a general election and their opinion of Barack Obama . \u201d\nHowever , she adds , \u201c I don \u2019 t think they like Biden as an independent person who \u2019 s running and has policies they are enamored with . \u201d\nThis latter point is telling : Given criticism of the former vice president \u2019 s record on some issues and arguments that he isn \u2019 t strong enough on matters of racial justice to be the best pick for black voters , there could be an opening for a different candidate to pull support from Biden in the coming months . But that candidate , and anyone else looking to shrink Biden \u2019 s lead with black voters , needs to be working to make inroads with them now .\nOther 2020 candidates have a chance to capitalize on splits among black voters\nWhile Biden might have the majority of the black vote now , his support can \u2019 t really be taken for granted . Just look what happened to Clinton .\nGenerally speaking , at this point , someone defined as a \u201c black Biden voter \u201d looks very similar to those who strongly backed Clinton in the early months of the 2008 primary : they \u2019 re more likely to be older , are more closely aligned with the Democratic Party , and in Biden \u2019 s case are more interested in returning to a stable state of affairs after Trump than voting for a change agent .\nAnd while all of this is currently working in Biden \u2019 s favor , it isn \u2019 t a completely sure thing that this will permanently be the case . After all , much like in 2008 , many of these voters could still move if they believe another candidate stands a better chance of winning the primary . As Angela Geter , the Democratic Party chair in South Carolina \u2019 s Spartanburg County , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this month , \u201c Nobody has it in the bag . Everybody needs to put in the work . \u201d\nIn fact , recent reporting from the New York Times has highlighted that some of the splits among black voters seen in recent elections are already highly noticeable in the current primary contest . Older black women and men , for example , are far more sold on Biden than their younger counterparts , a trend consistent with the 2008 and 2016 primary cycles . A September Essence poll found that black women aged 18-34 ranked Biden fourth , putting him behind Sanders , Harris , and Warren . Older black women , however , ranked Biden first , supporting him in high enough numbers to make him the overall leader in the poll .\nAnd while October polling shows that roughly 40 percent of African American respondents support Biden right now , his numbers with black voters under 45 are lower than that . The aforementioned Morning Consult poll , for example , finds that just 32 percent of black voters ages 35-44 support Biden . For the youngest bloc of voters , aged 18-29 , this number falls to 29 percent .\nThe figures match with what experts tracking black voters of different ages have seen . Those who are not Biden supporters are more likely to be ( but aren \u2019 t exclusively ) younger and are often further to the left in their ideology . When they look at Biden , they see not stability but a candidate whose call to return to the Obama era is insufficient to deal with the current political reality \u2014 a reality that differs in many ways from what Obama himself faced while in office .\nThere are also questions about how Biden would navigate a political landscape that has been further shaped by a surge in activism among the black Left and a growing desire for antiracism among some white liberals . And as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Ezra Klein wrote in September , the fact that Biden differs from the 44th president in terms of style , politics , and demographics means that he \u201c will not be able to pursue an Obama-like campaign or run an Obama-like administration , \u201d something that goes against his efforts to present himself as a natural continuation of the Obama presidency .\nThere have also a been series of issues on the campaign trail \u2014 including Biden \u2019 s opposition to using busing for school desegregation in the 1970s , his support for the 1994 crime bill , and his many recent unforced errors when discussing race and policy \u2014 that are a large part of the reason why many younger black voters say they \u2019 re looking to take their votes elsewhere .

        "content_original": "Black voters are getting a significant amount of attention these days.\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019s a welcome development: After years of helping Democrats secure crucial election victories, black voters are being recognized as an influential voting bloc. This was perhaps most notable in 2008 and 2012, where their increased turnout helped deliver the White House to Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president.\n\nBut black voters had been wielding their power even before this, in situations like the 1984 Democratic primary, where the support of black voters single-handedly turned Jesse Jackson into a contender, or the 1992 primaries, which saw black voters help Bill Clinton secure the party\u2019s nomination. Since the 1990s, black voters have largely backed the candidate that has gone on to win the Democratic nomination, cementing the group\u2019s status as powerful players in presidential politics.\n\nBut that does not mean black voters are a monolith.\n\nJust a reminder ...\n\nNote that Democrsts haven't won white folks in decades.\n\nNote that Carter, Clinton, and Obama all won without winning white folks.\n\nMoral: follow the votes and invest in communities of color pic.twitter.com/cA7JMr1J34 \u2014 Leah D. Daughtry (@LeahDaughtry) September 15, 2019\n\nIn other words, there isn\u2019t a single black vote. There are many. A seemingly monolithic black electorate often coalesces only after individual black voters make decisions based on a nuanced set of political calculations.\n\n\u201cBlack voters today are behaving in a very smart and strategic way that they\u2019ve always behaved in, but no one ever really lets us be smart,\u201d says Keneshia Grant, an assistant professor of political science at Howard University. \u201cBlack voters get viewed as sheep who are being told where to go, and I think that\u2019s wrong and the data shows that this is wrong.\u201d\n\nBlack voters, much like other voters in the electorate, have varying ideologies. Some are more conservative than others. Some are far more progressive. And there other splits as well, along lines of age, gender, income, and geography. This has always been the case, and yet, it is rarely discussed in mainstream political conversations about courting black voters.\n\nIt\u2019s an important reality, though, and could become particularly significant in the current election cycle. While prior elections have shown a united black vote, over the past few months black political journalists, strategists, and academics have made the argument that the 2020 race is incredibly fluid. With so many candidates in play, black voters could potentially spread their vote across multiple candidates in early-primary and caucus states, or push their support to a different candidate than former Vice President Joe Biden, the current frontrunner.\n\nIn fact, a lot of black voters (like voters more broadly) have said they are open to switching to a different candidate or are undecided about who to support, and the next few months of campaigning could be especially important for any campaign hoping to attract as many black voters as possible. Candidates need to do more than black outreach, though: They also must show a clear understanding of black voters, their needs, and their concerns.\n\n\u201cBased on the different demographics of the black electorate, you do have some people making different choices about who their top candidate is or who their second choice is,\u201d Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a group focused on increasing black political power, tells Vox. \u201cThat is what is most distinctive about the black vote now. It isn\u2019t exactly going en masse to one place.\u201d\n\nWhat black primary voting has looked like in prior elections\n\nTo understand what\u2019s at stake when it comes to winning black voters in 2020, it\u2019s helpful to understand how this group has voted in previous elections. A 2019 analysis from NBC News offers one of the most comprehensive histories of black voting behavior for the nine competitive national Democratic primaries that have occurred since exit polling began in the 1970s.\n\nThat project found that black voters have become an increasingly important share of the Democratic Party, going from a bloc that drew national attention as it flexed its muscle during the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson \u2014 forcing concessions and promises from the Democratic Party in the process \u2014 to a group that 20 years later helped Barack Obama gain the electoral advantage necessary for him to clinch the 2008 Democratic nomination.\n\nIn what is perhaps more predicative to the 2020 election, though, the NBC News project showed that black voters have become powerful because of how they vote, with this demographic often rallying around a single candidate as the primary voting continues \u2014 but not always before. Securing a high margin of votes from black people can make it easier for candidates to win decisive victories in states with high black populations, helping to tip the nomination toward them.\n\nTake, for example, the aforementioned 2008 Democratic presidential primary. While then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s success over Hillary Clinton is often remembered \u2014 as is the fact that black voters began to overwhelmingly support him after the Iowa Caucus \u2014 what often isn\u2019t as readily acknowledged is that for months before this, there had been a noticeable split in the black voters backing him and the black voters who weren\u2019t. Early in the contest, Obama was supported mainly by younger black voters, as older voters and many black politicians backed Clinton, pointing to her established history in the black community, her work during her husband\u2019s presidential administration, and for some, their belief that Obama wasn\u2019t well-known enough to be electable.\n\nBut when a majority of this group flipped to Obama in 2008, they helped him advance further, propelling him to a win in South Carolina weeks later. Obama also won every primary held in a state where blacks were more than 20 percent of the population, and in some states, he managed to win over as much as 90 percent of black voters.\n\nThat primary offers a lot of lessons. For one, it shows that the margin of victory for a candidate among black voters matters almost as much as the victory itself, meaning that it\u2019s in a candidate\u2019s best interest to push their support among black voters as high as it can possibly go. The 2008 primary also provides one example of how black voting power has worked in recent elections: showing how a presumed frontrunner who was banking on black support (Clinton), and actually did have a lot of support from specific groups of black voters and the black political class, saw much of her lead evaporate after a different candidate proved they could also get votes from different portions of the electorate.\n\nAnd after the primary, the 2008 general election also showed that black voters responded well to continued engagement and outreach later in the election cycle, with their turnout reaching historic levels in 2008 and 2012.\n\nBut if 2008 showed how black voters could help turn a candidate from an underdog to a presidential nominee, eight years later, in 2016, black voters showed how withholding their votes could keep a candidate\u2019s chances as a longshot.\n\nIn this cycle, Clinton, again the presumed frontrunner, faced off against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. However, this time, Clinton\u2019s lead with black voters held, helping her win the nomination. But there were fractures among black voters that were often overlooked or dismissed in discussions of the contest: a large chunk of young black voters, much as they had for Obama, broke for Sanders early and stayed with him through the primary, and also played a key role in Sanders winning in Michigan. But what differed this time is the fact that Sanders was unable to pull many older black voters to his side.\n\nThe story of black voters in 2016 has largely focused less on the primary than on the general election, with news reports in the immediate days after the November election focusing on how black turnout declined compared to 2008 and 2012. But when it comes to actually understanding differences among black voters, the 2016 primary matters: It shows some important differences among black voters that have only grown more pronounced in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, the differences between Sanders and Clinton supporters weren\u2019t just a matter of a younger voter/older voter split or a geographic one. Clinton also did better with black women than black men and attracted more support from more moderate black voters looking to maintain the gains of the Obama era rather than adopt an agenda of radical change. On the other hand, she also got less support from young black progressives looking for a jolt to the system, many of whom criticized Clinton\u2019s record on issues like racial justice.\n\nThis reveals some important divides in how black voters settled on her candidacy and shows that while the majority of black voters may have backed Clinton, there were many different reasons and motivations behind why they did (and in some cases did not). More importantly, the way these divides intersect and diverge is critical to understanding the behavior of the black electorate now. Elections may have shown that black voters often become an electoral monolith, but they are far from being an ideological one.\n\n\u201cBlack America is no more monolithic than any other group,\u201d Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies African American politics and black voter behavior patterns, told Vox. \u201cWhatever the spectrum is for ideology and politics, black voters are scattered all along that spectrum just like any other racial group.\u201d\n\nBiden is currently the leading choice for black voters \u2014 but that lead isn\u2019t indestructible\n\nIn the 2020 election cycle, it\u2019s likely that we will see high black turnout and enthusiasm. Many black voters will mobilize for a number of reasons: a desire to oust Trump, an interest in a new anti-racist policy agenda in the White House, and a hope for change on the issues affecting their daily lives and communities.\n\n\u201cBlack voters want to back the candidate who is going to win, and in the Trump era, that also means backing the person most likely to push Trump out of office,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nWith the start of primary voting still a few months away, we can\u2019t definitively say who will benefit from this. Currently, polling shows former Vice President Joe Biden having a large lead among black voters, beating his competitors by double digits with this group. Biden is banking on black support, and his team has increasingly indicated that it sees the majority-black South Carolina primary, which will happen on February 29, as critical to his chances of winning the nomination. According to an October poll from Winthrop University, for now, his plan is solid: 46 percent of black voters in South Carolina say he\u2019s the most likely candidate to get their support.\n\n\u201cThe black folks support Biden, next to Jesus right now, that\u2019s where he is,\u201d Dot Scott, head of Charleston\u2019s NAACP chapter, told Vox\u2019s Li Zhou recently, pointing to Biden\u2019s deep ties to black communities in the state and his role as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\nWhen the primary began earlier this year, some experts thought things would turn out differently. \u201cI went into [this election cycle] thinking that this would be a cycle where we would see black voters\u2019 political diversity at play,\u201d Johnson told me. He noted that last winter and spring, the field seemed to be wide open and full of relatively unknown candidates of different ages, racial backgrounds, genders, and political ideologies, potentially leaving black voters to spread out across multiple candidates.\n\nBut that changed once a particular candidate entered the race. \u201cAs soon as Biden jumped in, it sort of ruined the calculus,\u201d Johnson says of the former vice president\u2019s leap to the top of the polls this spring, a position he has maintained (with some stumbles) in the months since. \u201cHe\u2019s such a known quantity.\u201d\n\nSomebody gotta say it: The overwhelming support for Joe Biden is based purely off fear that white folks won\u2019t vote for anyone else on that stage. Because there is no way you see him in these moments and think he\u2019s actually the best candidate. \u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 13, 2019\n\nAs I wrote in June, there are a lot of reasons why some black voters started lining up behind Biden early. Some black voters say their support makes sense given their pragmatism, and they believe that Biden is the only \u201celectable\u201d candidate who will be supported by more moderate white voters and some conservatives unwilling to vote for Trump. Other black voters place a lot of importance on Biden\u2019s role as Obama\u2019s vice president and support him due to that history. And some black voters believe that Biden is actually the best policy choice, that his incremental approach to civil rights and call for a return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d is the right one in this particular moment. There are voters who believe more than one of these things and others who believe all three.\n\n\u201cThere is an aspect of this that is about who can put up the fight that is going to be required to take Trump down,\u201d Shropshire tells me. \u201cAnd some black people know that part of Biden\u2019s narrative is that he\u2019s a fighter and that he fought for Obama. And that is not insignificant.\u201d\n\nSome of these arguments have been pushed frequently by the Biden campaign, which has repeatedly emphasized the former vice president\u2019s connection to black voters, particularly the older, more moderate voters who regularly turn out for elections. \u201cThey have a sense of who my character is and who I am \u2014 warts and all,\u201d Biden told a group of black reporters in August.\n\nPolling also shows that this group is supporting Biden strongly. An October poll from Morning Consult, for example, found that Biden has 48 percent support among black voters aged 45-54, 53 percent among those aged 55-64, and 56 percent among those 65 and older.\n\nBiden is also quick to remind voters of his role in the Obama administration, which also likely plays a role in these numbers. \u201cThe Biden campaign has been masterful at messaging Biden as the \u2018great friend and ally of Barack Obama,\u2019 who Obama loved so much and chose as his vice president,\u201d Grant, the Howard University professor, says. \u201cTo the extent that black people are saying that they support Joe Biden, I think that they are supporting who they think has the highest likelihood of being competitive in a general election and their opinion of Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nHowever, she adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think they like Biden as an independent person who\u2019s running and has policies they are enamored with.\u201d\n\nThis latter point is telling: Given criticism of the former vice president\u2019s record on some issues and arguments that he isn\u2019t strong enough on matters of racial justice to be the best pick for black voters, there could be an opening for a different candidate to pull support from Biden in the coming months. But that candidate, and anyone else looking to shrink Biden\u2019s lead with black voters, needs to be working to make inroads with them now.\n\nOther 2020 candidates have a chance to capitalize on splits among black voters\n\nWhile Biden might have the majority of the black vote now, his support can\u2019t really be taken for granted. Just look what happened to Clinton.\n\nGenerally speaking, at this point, someone defined as a \u201cblack Biden voter\u201d looks very similar to those who strongly backed Clinton in the early months of the 2008 primary: they\u2019re more likely to be older, are more closely aligned with the Democratic Party, and in Biden\u2019s case are more interested in returning to a stable state of affairs after Trump than voting for a change agent.\n\nAnd while all of this is currently working in Biden\u2019s favor, it isn\u2019t a completely sure thing that this will permanently be the case. After all, much like in 2008, many of these voters could still move if they believe another candidate stands a better chance of winning the primary. As Angela Geter, the Democratic Party chair in South Carolina\u2019s Spartanburg County, told Vox earlier this month, \u201cNobody has it in the bag. Everybody needs to put in the work.\u201d\n\nIn fact, recent reporting from the New York Times has highlighted that some of the splits among black voters seen in recent elections are already highly noticeable in the current primary contest. Older black women and men, for example, are far more sold on Biden than their younger counterparts, a trend consistent with the 2008 and 2016 primary cycles. A September Essence poll found that black women aged 18-34 ranked Biden fourth, putting him behind Sanders, Harris, and Warren. Older black women, however, ranked Biden first, supporting him in high enough numbers to make him the overall leader in the poll.\n\nAnd while October polling shows that roughly 40 percent of African American respondents support Biden right now, his numbers with black voters under 45 are lower than that. The aforementioned Morning Consult poll, for example, finds that just 32 percent of black voters ages 35-44 support Biden. For the youngest bloc of voters, aged 18-29, this number falls to 29 percent.\n\nThe figures match with what experts tracking black voters of different ages have seen. Those who are not Biden supporters are more likely to be (but aren\u2019t exclusively) younger and are often further to the left in their ideology. When they look at Biden, they see not stability but a candidate whose call to return to the Obama era is insufficient to deal with the current political reality \u2014 a reality that differs in many ways from what Obama himself faced while in office.\n\nThere are also questions about how Biden would navigate a political landscape that has been further shaped by a surge in activism among the black Left and a growing desire for antiracism among some white liberals. And as Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein wrote in September, the fact that Biden differs from the 44th president in terms of style, politics, and demographics means that he \u201cwill not be able to pursue an Obama-like campaign or run an Obama-like administration,\u201d something that goes against his efforts to present himself as a natural continuation of the Obama presidency.\n\nThere have also a been series of issues on the campaign trail \u2014 including Biden\u2019s opposition to using busing for school desegregation in the 1970s, his support for the 1994 crime bill, and his many recent unforced errors when discussing race and policy \u2014 that are a large part of the reason why many younger black voters say they\u2019re looking to take their votes elsewhere. Some of them are trying to convince their elders to do the same.\n\nMany of these Biden skeptics would likely fall into the roughly 20 percent of respondents who told the Black Census Project earlier this year that the Democratic Party is taking African Americans for granted.

In the wake of critiques from some African Americans that a black woman can\u2019t win against the current president, she has also been more proactive than other candidates in going after Trump.\n\nBooker, the only other black candidate, has noticeably struggled to find an exact lane with black voters. But he has focused on highlighting a message of hope and justice while speaking with mannerisms of the black church, suggesting that for now at least, he is likely looking to peel voters from any of the other candidates.\n\nOther candidates have largely used issue agendas and discussions of racial justice, be they platforms focused on specific issues like police violence and reform (Juli\u00e1n Castro) or larger \u201cblack agenda\u201d platforms addressing a number of issues comprehensively (Pete Buttigieg) when making appeals to black voters.\n\nIn another primary cycle, these pitches \u2014 and the fact that the Democrats have the most diverse primary field in history \u2014 might have been more persuasive to black voters. But right now, many these candidates, and especially the candidates of color, haven\u2019t really risen to the top of the list for many black voters.\n\nThe candidate who currently faces the biggest pressure to reach black voters \u2014 and also stands to make the biggest gain with black voters as of now \u2014 is Warren, who has seen her level of national support among black voters increase several points in recent months but has not done well enough yet to catch Biden.

And as she works to cut into Biden\u2019s lead in South Carolina, Warren is also trying to build connections with black community leaders in an effort to grow her base of support.\n\nThose efforts are being watched closely by black voters, and they could become extremely important in the coming months. \u201cShe\u2019s playing the long game \u2014 black voter outreach isn\u2019t something where you do it well for a month and then see voters swing,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBut if Biden stumbles, she\u2019s there to pick up all of that support because she\u2019s putting in the work now.\u201d\n\nUndecided black voters could also play a big role in the primary and the general election\n\nOf course, all of this talk about black voters and the differences between them overlooks something else about black voters a few months before the first primary contests: A lot of them are still undecided about who they will vote for.

Who black voters, individually, will ultimately vote for is far from settled. Their process of determining who to support can\u2019t be reduced to simple statements about a universal \u201cblack vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be a misjudgment for people to think that any of these numbers are baked,\u201d says Shropshire. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much time left.\u201d",

Government officials often portray that accomplishment as a result of current or recent arms control agreements, but the overwhelming portion of the reduction happened in the 1990s. Some also compare today\u2019s numbers with that of the 1950s, but that is like comparing apples and oranges; today\u2019s forces are vastly more capable. The pace of reduction has slowed significantly compared with the 1990s. Instead of planning for nuclear disarmament, the nuclear-armed states appear to plan to retain large arsenals for the indefinite future, are adding new nuclear weapons, and are increasing the role that such weapons play in their national strategies.\n\nDespite progress in reducing Cold War nuclear arsenals, the world\u2019s combined inventory of nuclear warheads remains at a very high level: roughly 13,890 warheads as of early-2019. Of these, approximately 9,330 are in the military stockpiles (the rest are awaiting dismantlement), of which some 3,600 warheads are deployed with operational forces, of which about 1,800 US, Russian, British and French warheads are on high alert, ready for use on short notice.\n\nApproximately 93 percent of all nuclear warheads are owned by Russia and the United States who each have around 4,000 warheads in their military stockpiles; no other nuclear-armed state sees a need for more than a few hundred nuclear weapons for national security:\n\nGlobally, the number of nuclear weapons is declining, but the pace of reduction is slowing compared with the past 25 years.

        "content": "Tuesday 's Vice Presidential debate was like a bad version of `` Waiting for Godot '' : The questions lacked focus . The conversation meandered . The men spoke past one another .\nElaine Quijano , the debate 's moderator , lost control of the debate . Fiercely committed to her script , she stopped the candidates when they were in the middle of a good discussion and failed to stop them when they were simply talking over one another .\n`` Elaine Quijano seems intent on running through her questions , even when significant exchanges are happening , '' David Axelrod , CNN senior political commentator , observed on Twitter .\n. @ Elaine_Quijano seems intent on running through her questions , even when significant exchanges are happening . # VPDebate \u2014 David Axelrod ( @ davidaxelrod ) October 5 , 2016\nThe most notable example came when Quijano switched topics just as Sen. Tim Kaine was pressing Gov . Mike Pence to explain why he had not defended his running mate Donald Trump on six different issues . Instead of letting what may have been a very revealing conversation play out , she moved the discussion along .\n`` Elaine Quijano should occasionally go where the debate is going , and not stop these interesting arguments , '' Jeffrey Goldberg , the Atlantic 's national correspondent , tweeted shortly after that moment .\nElaine Quijano should occasionally go where the debate is going , and not stop these interesting arguments . \u2014 Jeffrey Goldberg ( @ JeffreyGoldberg ) October 5 , 2016\n`` Why change the topic at the best moment ? '' asked Kenneth Li , the managing editor at Newsweek .\nAt other times , Quijano seemed almost powerless to stop the candidates from simply bickering with one another . She was even forced to reprimand both candidates at one point , telling them : `` Gentlemen , the people at home can not understand you when you speak over each other .

Police shot at Zambrano-Montes 17 times , hitting him five to six times , after he allegedly threw rocks at them .

In January , he was caught in a house fire that destroyed his belongings .\n`` What I know is that he was alone , that his wife had left him , that he could n't see his daughters , '' Pedro Farias , his 32-year-old cousin , told the Times . `` I do n't know what his reasons were '' for throwing rocks at police , `` but I know all of this affected him . ''\nAmong the similarities between Ferguson , Missouri , and Pasco are racial disparities between the city 's residents and local government . Pasco is nearly 56 percent Hispanic , but its local government is n't representative of the city 's racial makeup , the New York Times reported :\nOf the city 's 68 officers , 14 are Hispanic . A dozen officers speak Spanish fluently , and some residents cite language barriers that complicate interactions with the police . The [ seven-person ] City Council has one Latino member . The five-member school board , which oversees a system that is 70 percent Latino , typically has one or two Latino members , but this year has none .\nThe same was true in Ferguson following the August 9 police shooting of Michael Brown . The St. Louis suburb is 67 percent black , but at the time of the Brown shooting the mayor and police chief were white , just one of six city council members was black , zero school board members were black , and only three out of 53 commissioned police officers were black , according to the Los Angeles Times .\nThe Zambrano-Montes shooting fanned tensions between the local Hispanic community and city government . Hundreds of protesters marched in the week following Zambrano-Montes ' death , with some voicing concerns that their own children could be killed by police . In response , the Pasco Police Department claimed it 's working to recruit more Hispanic officers .\nSimilar protests , now under the banner of `` Black Lives Matter , '' came about following several police killings of black boys and men in 2014 . In Ferguson , former police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown , an unarmed 18-year-old . In Ohio , police killed 22-year-old John Crawford and 12-year-old Tamir Rice in two separate shootings after mistaking toy guns for actual weapons . In New York City , NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner by putting the unarmed 43-year-old black man in a chokehold .\nData for police shootings is spotty , but it 's particularly bad for Hispanic victims\nThe most reliable data on police shootings , gathered by the FBI through local and state agencies , is extremely limited \u2014 to the point that some criminal justice experts disavow analyzing it altogether \u2014 since it 's based on voluntary self-reporting . But the data is especially limited for Hispanic victims of police shootings .\nSamuel Walker , a retired criminal justice professor from the University of Nebraska at Omaha , said there 's no research on how many Hispanic victims are left out of police shooting data , but he has reason to believe they 're undercounted .\nWalker pointed out that other parts of the criminal justice system sometimes classify Hispanic people as white , likely overestimating the number of non-Hispanic white people shot and killed by police and underestimating Hispanic victims . In many cases , determinations of race and ethnicity are made by low-level officials , potentially leading to even more errors based on perceptions and prejudices regarding race .\nFlorida , the state with the third largest Hispanic population , is entirely excluded from the FBI 's national tally of police shootings , further skewing the numbers .\n`` In short , '' Walker wrote in an email , `` we have no reliable data on Hispanic/Latino people shot and killed by the police . ''\nCops can legally shoot when they reasonably perceive a threat\nTwo Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s , Tennessee vs. Garner and Graham v. Connor , set the legal framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonable .\nConstitutionally , `` police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances , '' David Klinger , a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor who studies law enforcement officers ' use of force , said in August . The first circumstance is `` to protect their life or the life of another innocent party '' \u2014 referred to as the `` defense-of-life '' standard by police departments . The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping , but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to others .\nThe logic behind the second circumstance , Klinger explained , comes from Tennessee vs. Garner . That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15-year-old boy as he fled from a burglary . ( He 'd stolen $ 10 and a purse from a house . ) The court ruled that cops could n't shoot every felon who tried to escape . But , as Klinger said , `` they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence , and if you 've got a violent person who 's fleeing , you can shoot them to stop their flight . ''\nwhat matters is the officer 's `` objectively reasonable '' belief that there is a threat\nThe key to both of the legal standards \u2014 defense-of-life and stopping a fleeing violent felon \u2014 is that it does n't matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used . Instead , what matters is the officer 's `` objectively reasonable '' belief that there is a threat .\nThat standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides use-of-force decisions : Graham v. Connor . This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who survived his encounter with police officers , but was treated roughly , had his face shoved into the hood of a car , and broke his foot \u2014 all while suffering a diabetic attack . The court did n't rule on whether the officers ' actions had been justified , but said police could n't justify their conduct solely based on whether their intentions were good . They had to demonstrate that their actions were `` objectively reasonable , '' given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might do .\nWhat 's `` objectively reasonable '' changes as the circumstances change . `` One ca n't just say , 'Because I could use deadly force 10 seconds ago , that means I can use deadly force again now , ' '' Walter Katz , a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies , said in August .\nIn the case of Zambrano-Montes , the legal questions are whether he was actually fleeing after he turned around and whether he posed an imminent threat to the officers or others , which police could substantiate if he was throwing rocks at officers as they allege .",

In many cases, determinations of race and ethnicity are made by low-level officials, potentially leading to even more errors based on perceptions and prejudices regarding race.\n\nFlorida, the state with the third largest Hispanic population, is entirely excluded from the FBI's national tally of police shootings, further skewing the numbers.\n\n\"In short,\" Walker wrote in an email, \"we have no reliable data on Hispanic/Latino people shot and killed by the police.\"\n\nCops can legally shoot when they reasonably perceive a threat\n\nTwo Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s, Tennessee vs. Garner and Graham v. Connor, set the legal framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonable.\n\nConstitutionally, \"police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances,\" David Klinger, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor who studies law enforcement officers' use of force, said in August. The first circumstance is \"to protect their life or the life of another innocent party\" \u2014 referred to as the \"defense-of-life\" standard by police departments. The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping, but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to others.\n\nThe logic behind the second circumstance, Klinger explained, comes from Tennessee vs. Garner. That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15-year-old boy as he fled from a burglary. (He'd stolen $10 and a purse from a house.) The court ruled that cops couldn't shoot every felon who tried to escape. But, as Klinger said, \"they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence, and if you've got a violent person who's fleeing, you can shoot them to stop their flight.\"\n\nwhat matters is the officer's \"objectively reasonable\" belief that there is a threat\n\nThe key to both of the legal standards \u2014 defense-of-life and stopping a fleeing violent felon \u2014 is that it doesn't matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used. Instead, what matters is the officer's \"objectively reasonable\" belief that there is a threat.\n\nThat standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides use-of-force decisions: Graham v. Connor. This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who survived his encounter with police officers, but was treated roughly, had his face shoved into the hood of a car, and broke his foot \u2014 all while suffering a diabetic attack. The court didn't rule on whether the officers' actions had been justified, but said police couldn't justify their conduct solely based on whether their intentions were good. They had to demonstrate that their actions were \"objectively reasonable,\" given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might do.\n\nWhat's \"objectively reasonable\" changes as the circumstances change. \"One can't just say, 'Because I could use deadly force 10 seconds ago, that means I can use deadly force again now,'\" Walter Katz, a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies, said in August.\n\nIn the case of Zambrano-Montes, the legal questions are whether he was actually fleeing after he turned around and whether he posed an imminent threat to the officers or others, which police could substantiate if he was throwing rocks at officers as they allege.",

And even those who have signaled support for Mr. Obama \u2019 s stance on taxes are also pressing Democrats to rein in spending .\nDuring a closed question session after Mr. Obama \u2019 s speech Wednesday , Kenneth I. Chenault , chief executive of American Express , emphasized that entitlement overhaul was necessary to address long-term deficits , along with tax increases and other spending cuts , according to a chief executive in the room .\nStephen A. Schwarzman , chief executive of the Blackstone Group , pointed out that while taxes were lower compared to the economy as a whole than they had been , spending was well above the historical norm . Robert A. McDonald , chief executive of Procter & Gamble , asked about a comprehensive corporate tax overhaul .\nSome conservatives are as distrustful of corporate America as they are of big government .\n\u201c Large corporations are seekers of welfare as much as anybody , \u201d said Chris Chocola , president of the Club for Growth , an antitax group . \u201c When he has all these guys to the White House , it \u2019 s not surprising that they agree with the president . They helped create the current system , and they have a vested interest in a sense in making it worse . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s argument to business leaders focuses on stability , saying that even if they oppose his plans , they should want the fiscal crisis resolved for the sake of the economy . He also is promising them that he will consider a broader overhaul of the tax code next year that could even lower corporate tax rates in exchange for eliminating special breaks .\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box .

There \u2019 s no uncertainty like the prospect that the United States of America , the largest economy that holds the world \u2019 s reserve currency , potentially defaults on its debts . \u201d\nThe administration brought home the possibility that a painful series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts will go into effect with the new year if no agreement is reached . The White House Office of Management and Budget asked agencies this week for information about how they would institute the deep spending cuts if there were no deal .\nRepublicans called on Mr. Obama to dispense with the public campaign and begin serious negotiations . Speaker John A.

        "content_original": "The White House hopes such statements help crack Republican solidarity.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in there who support the Republican Congress, who were \u2018super PAC\u2019 donors to Mitt Romney, yet they want a solution here,\u201d David Plouffe, the president\u2019s senior adviser, said after the Business Roundtable visit. \u201cA lot of them have special influence in the Republican Party, and if they\u2019re telling Republican leaders and members that they have to compromise, that\u2019s going to have a real effect.\u201d\n\nStill, plenty of business leaders oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s plans, and Republicans countered Wednesday by releasing comments from small-business owners saying that higher tax rates would stifle their firms. And even those who have signaled support for Mr. Obama\u2019s stance on taxes are also pressing Democrats to rein in spending.\n\nDuring a closed question session after Mr. Obama\u2019s speech Wednesday, Kenneth I. Chenault, chief executive of American Express, emphasized that entitlement overhaul was necessary to address long-term deficits, along with tax increases and other spending cuts, according to a chief executive in the room.\n\nStephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, pointed out that while taxes were lower compared to the economy as a whole than they had been, spending was well above the historical norm. Robert A. McDonald, chief executive of Procter & Gamble, asked about a comprehensive corporate tax overhaul.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome conservatives are as distrustful of corporate America as they are of big government.\n\n\u201cLarge corporations are seekers of welfare as much as anybody,\u201d said Chris Chocola, president of the Club for Growth, an antitax group. \u201cWhen he has all these guys to the White House, it\u2019s not surprising that they agree with the president. They helped create the current system, and they have a vested interest in a sense in making it worse.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s argument to business leaders focuses on stability, saying that even if they oppose his plans, they should want the fiscal crisis resolved for the sake of the economy. He also is promising them that he will consider a broader overhaul of the tax code next year that could even lower corporate tax rates in exchange for eliminating special breaks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There\u2019s no uncertainty like the prospect that the United States of America, the largest economy that holds the world\u2019s reserve currency, potentially defaults on its debts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration brought home the possibility that a painful series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts will go into effect with the new year if no agreement is reached. The White House Office of Management and Budget asked agencies this week for information about how they would institute the deep spending cuts if there were no deal.\n\nRepublicans called on Mr. Obama to dispense with the public campaign and begin serious negotiations. Speaker John A. Boehner did not give an inch Wednesday on his opposition to raising tax rates or insistence that any deficit-reduction plan emphasize spending cuts.\n\nBut he sounded exasperated as he insisted that he had moved toward the president\u2019s position by agreeing to $800 billion in higher tax revenue over 10 years by curtailing tax breaks. \u201cThe revenues we\u2019re putting on the table will come from guess who?

Kendi: Stop blaming black people for dying of the coronavirus\n\nFinally, by emphasizing disparity figures without context, Chowkwanyun and Reed write, we encourage the false impression \u201cthat certain social problems are primarily \u2018racial\u2019\u2014and therefore of concern only to supposed minority interest groups.\u201d Context might reveal, for example, that black people are hit harder because they use crowded public transportation at a higher rate than white people, or because they are more likely to work in jobs that require in-person interaction. Neither of these factors is exclusive to one race or another, and absent this context, it would be easy to dismiss COVID-19 as a \u201cblack disease,\u201d much as AIDS became a \u201cgay disease,\u201d to the detriment of gay and nongay alike.\n\nJim Downs: The epidemics America got wrong\n\nChowkwanyun and Reed advocate instead an approach that focuses less on outrage and more on hard data. \u201cPeople need to take a breather to parse data in more sophisticated ways,\u201d Chowkwanyun told me. He warned against a \u201cpro forma\u201d kind of racial-disparity research that simply says We have a racial disparity here, and we have to react to it. It\u2019s outrageous! \u201cJust saying \u2018There\u2019s racism here\u2019 can be counterproductive. We are pushing people to be more precise.\u201d\n\nThat means collecting data that currently do not exist. \u201cWhen a patient comes to a clinic, they can self-report their race, but how do they self-report socioeconomic status? How do you actually gather that information?\u201d Most states still aren\u2019t collecting the relevant data systematically\u2014not even data on race, let alone other characteristics.",

A public memorial service is planned , they said .\n`` The outpouring of love and support over the last week has been tremendous , '' Denise and Bill Richard said in the statement . `` We laid our son Martin to rest , and he is now at peace . ''\nFamily , friends and colleagues mourned slain Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier at a private memorial service in Stoneham , Massachusetts , CNN affiliate WHDH reported .\nA memorial service open to law enforcement officers and the MIT community is scheduled for Wednesday on MIT 's campus , the university said .\nCollier was killed Thursday night , near the beginning of a wild 24 hours that culminated in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 's capture in the backyard of a home in Watertown , a Boston suburb . Authorities suspect Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother of killing the officer , though Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has not been charged in Collier 's death .\nAccording to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation , Collier did n't even have time to activate his emergency alert before being shot four or five times in the chest and head as he sat in his patrol car on the MIT campus .\nIt 's not clear why the brothers allegedly ambushed the officer , the source said .\nThe source said investigators believe the Tsarnaevs then carjacked a black SUV , took the driver hostage and drove past the scene of the shooting before going to a gas station .\nInvestigators believe Tamerlan Tsarnaev carried out the car jacking while his younger brother was nearby at the time , a U.S. official told CNN Tuesday .\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate WMUR , a man identifying himself as the carjacking victim said he was worried for his life .\n`` They asked me where I 'm from . I told them I 'm Chinese , '' WMUR quoted the man as saying . `` I was very scared . I asked them if they were going to hurt me . They said they wo n't hurt me . I was thinking , ' I think they will kill me later . ' ``\nThe man escaped when the brothers stopped to fill up the gas tank , running for his life as one of the brothers swore at him , WMUR reported .\nMore than two months before the marathon bombings , Tamerlan Tsarnaev bought two reloadable mortar style fireworks a New Hampshire store .\nOn February 6 , Tsarnaev had one question for a store assistant at Phantom Fireworks in Seabrook , New Hampshire : `` What 's the biggest and loudest thing you have ? ''\nAfter that , store Vice President William Weimer said , Tsarnaev shelled out $ 200 cash for two `` lock and load kits . ''\nWeimer said such behavior is very common in the store . He said the store notified the FBI after discovering that the marathon bombing suspect had bought explosives there .\nLaw enforcement officials told CNN earlier Tuesday that the number of fireworks bought at the store was not enough to set off explosions the size of those at the Boston Marathon .\n`` My assumption is they bought this , experimented with it and decided against it and moved on and found another source , '' Weimer said .\nTamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead early Friday . On Friday night , police captured Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside a boat in a backyard .\nBoat owner David Henneberry told CNN affiliate WCVB Tuesday that his obsession with how his boat was stored just right led him to discover the suspect as he stood on a ladder replacing two pads that had fallen out of the shrink wrap protecting his boat for the winter .\n`` I got three steps up the ladder and rolled the shrink wrap . I did n't expect to see anything , but I saw blood on the floor of the boat . A good amount of blood . ... And I looked back and forth a couple of times and my eyes went to the engine block and there was a body , '' he told the affiliate .\nHenneberry said Tuesday that he does n't even remember climbing down the ladder and running to the phone to dial 911 , delivering the tip that would lead to Tsarnaev 's capture .\n`` I did n't waste any time . I did n't ask him if he wanted a cup of coffee . I was off that ladder . That is all I remember , '' he told the affiliate .\nInvestigators swarmed the scene , forming a perimeter . Multiple shots rang out from behind the house , Boston Police Superintendent William Evans said Tuesday .\nAuthorities are still investigating whether Tsarnaev was armed and whether a shootout occurred at the boat , Evans told reporters .\n`` Clearly from everybody 's vantage point , we could see whoever was in that boat was poking at that top , '' he said .\nIt was n't clear at the time , he said , whether the suspect had a handgun or was trying to poke a hole in the boat 's cover . After a standoff , hostage negotiators persuaded him to surrender , Evans said .\nThe Tsarnaev family is from the Russian republic of Chechnya and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s . The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan ; Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen in 2012 . His brother was a legal U.S. resident .\nAlthough Tamerlan Tsarnaev had become increasingly radical in the past three or four years , there was no evidence Tuesday of any accomplices or connections to extremists , a U.S. official said .\nBut Dzhokhar Tsarnaev conveyed to authorities that his brother believed Islam is under attack and its adherents must fight back , a U.S. government source said Monday .\nCommunicating with investigators by writing and nodding , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has indicated that his older brother masterminded the bombings , the source said .\nThe younger Tsarnaev has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death , as well as one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death .\nThe U.S. official said Tuesday that investigators have determined that the pressure cookers used in the attacks were purchased at a Macy 's department store .\nIn a statement issued through their lawyers Tuesday , the suspects ' sisters -- Ailina and Bella Tsarnaev -- said they were saddened `` to see so many innocent people hurt after such a callous act . ''\n`` As a family , we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused , '' they said . `` We do n't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation and hope to learn more . ''\nAnd Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's wife , Katherine Russell , issued a statement through her attorney 's office saying she is `` doing everything she can to assist with the investigation '' and said she and her family are shocked and distraught .\n`` The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all , '' the statement said .\nThe suspects ' mother , Zubeidat Tsarnaev , said Tuesday that she believed her sons had been framed .\nSpeaking from her home in Dagestan -- a Russian republic on the Caspian Sea -- Tsarnaev said she thinks her older son died because he was a Muslim and charged that authorities silenced her younger son to prevent him from defending himself .\nShe said family members have arranged for Tamerlan Tsarnaev to be buried at a mosque in Cambridge , Massachusetts , Tuesday or Wednesday .\nAn official with the Islamic Society of Boston said it has not received any funeral requests from the family . A spokesman for the chief medical examiner 's office also said officials there have heard nothing about plans by the slain suspect 's family to claim his body .",

Authorities suspect Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother of killing the officer, though Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has not been charged in Collier's death.\n\nAccording to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation, Collier didn't even have time to activate his emergency alert before being shot four or five times in the chest and head as he sat in his patrol car on the MIT campus.\n\nIt's not clear why the brothers allegedly ambushed the officer, the source said.\n\nThe source said investigators believe the Tsarnaevs then carjacked a black SUV, took the driver hostage and drove past the scene of the shooting before going to a gas station.\n\nCarjacking victim tells his story\n\nInvestigators believe Tamerlan Tsarnaev carried out the car jacking while his younger brother was nearby at the time, a U.S. official told CNN Tuesday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate WMUR, a man identifying himself as the carjacking victim said he was worried for his life.\n\n\"They asked me where I'm from. I told them I'm Chinese,\" WMUR quoted the man as saying. \"I was very scared. I asked them if they were going to hurt me. They said they won't hurt me. I was thinking, 'I think they will kill me later.' \"\n\nThe man escaped when the brothers stopped to fill up the gas tank, running for his life as one of the brothers swore at him, WMUR reported.\n\nSuspect shopped at fireworks store\n\nMore than two months before the marathon bombings, Tamerlan Tsarnaev bought two reloadable mortar style fireworks a New Hampshire store.\n\nOn February 6, Tsarnaev had one question for a store assistant at Phantom Fireworks in Seabrook, New Hampshire: \"What's the biggest and loudest thing you have?\"\n\nAfter that, store Vice President William Weimer said, Tsarnaev shelled out $200 cash for two \"lock and load kits.\"\n\nWeimer said such behavior is very common in the store. He said the store notified the FBI after discovering that the marathon bombing suspect had bought explosives there.\n\nLaw enforcement officials told CNN earlier Tuesday that the number of fireworks bought at the store was not enough to set off explosions the size of those at the Boston Marathon.\n\n\"My assumption is they bought this, experimented with it and decided against it and moved on and found another source,\" Weimer said.\n\nDetails emerge about boat, standoff\n\nTamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead early Friday. On Friday night, police captured Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside a boat in a backyard.\n\nBoat owner David Henneberry told CNN affiliate WCVB Tuesday that his obsession with how his boat was stored just right led him to discover the suspect as he stood on a ladder replacing two pads that had fallen out of the shrink wrap protecting his boat for the winter.\n\n\"I got three steps up the ladder and rolled the shrink wrap. I didn't expect to see anything, but I saw blood on the floor of the boat. A good amount of blood. ... And I looked back and forth a couple of times and my eyes went to the engine block and there was a body,\" he told the affiliate.\n\nHenneberry said Tuesday that he doesn't even remember climbing down the ladder and running to the phone to dial 911, delivering the tip that would lead to Tsarnaev's capture.\n\n\"I didn't waste any time. I didn't ask him if he wanted a cup of coffee. I was off that ladder. That is all I remember,\" he told the affiliate.\n\nInvestigators swarmed the scene, forming a perimeter. Multiple shots rang out from behind the house, Boston Police Superintendent William Evans said Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether Tsarnaev was armed and whether a shootout occurred at the boat, Evans told reporters.\n\n\"Clearly from everybody's vantage point, we could see whoever was in that boat was poking at that top,\" he said.\n\nIt wasn't clear at the time, he said, whether the suspect had a handgun or was trying to poke a hole in the boat's cover. After a standoff, hostage negotiators persuaded him to surrender, Evans said.\n\nInvestigation continues\n\nThe Tsarnaev family is from the Russian republic of Chechnya and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s. The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan; Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen in 2012. His brother was a legal U.S. resident.\n\nAlthough Tamerlan Tsarnaev had become increasingly radical in the past three or four years , there was no evidence Tuesday of any accomplices or connections to extremists, a U.S. official said.\n\nBut Dzhokhar Tsarnaev conveyed to authorities that his brother believed Islam is under attack and its adherents must fight back, a U.S. government source said Monday.\n\nCommunicating with investigators by writing and nodding, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has indicated that his older brother masterminded the bombings, the source said.\n\nThe younger Tsarnaev has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, as well as one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death.\n\nThe U.S. official said Tuesday that investigators have determined that the pressure cookers used in the attacks were purchased at a Macy's department store.\n\nSuspects' family members react\n\nIn a statement issued through their lawyers Tuesday, the suspects' sisters -- Ailina and Bella Tsarnaev -- said they were saddened \"to see so many innocent people hurt after such a callous act.\"\n\n\"As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused,\" they said. \"We don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation and hope to learn more.\"\n\nAnd Tamerlan Tsarnaev's wife, Katherine Russell, issued a statement through her attorney's office saying she is \"doing everything she can to assist with the investigation\" and said she and her family are shocked and distraught.\n\n\"The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all,\" the statement said.\n\nThe suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, said Tuesday that she believed her sons had been framed.\n\nSpeaking from her home in Dagestan -- a Russian republic on the Caspian Sea -- Tsarnaev said she thinks her older son died because he was a Muslim and charged that authorities silenced her younger son to prevent him from defending himself.\n\nShe said family members have arranged for Tamerlan Tsarnaev to be buried at a mosque in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nAn official with the Islamic Society of Boston said it has not received any funeral requests from the family. A spokesman for the chief medical examiner's office also said officials there have heard nothing about plans by the slain suspect's family to claim his body.",

        "content": "Rand Paul and Nate Morris were thousands of miles from their home state of Kentucky \u2014 and the United States \u2014 when Morris\u00ad realized just how fixated Paul was on a certain address back in Washington .\nIt was January 2013 , and Morris , a 34-year-old entrepreneur from Lexington who has been a door-opener for Paul with big-money GOP donors , was touring Israel with Paul . The two have traveled several times to Silicon Valley and Manhattan , where Morris , a big fundraiser for former President George W. Bush in 2004 , has introduced Paul to friends in the banking , venture capital and tech communities .\n\u201c We were getting off the bus at the Dead Sea , \u201d Morris said , and Paul was kibitzing about what he might ask then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her upcoming appearance on Benghazi before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .\nMorris pointed at Paul and cracked : \u201c This \u2019 d be a nice contrast in 2016 . \u201d\nHe clearly had the given the matter a lot of thought . \u201c I think you \u2019 re right , \u201d Paul said , according to Morris .\n\u201c We could have an interesting narrative in a general election . \u201d\nAll of which is to say that when Rand Paul , 52 , stands before a carefully chosen crowd at the Galt House Hotel in Louisville on Tuesday , it will prove one of the most anticlimactic presidential announcements of modern times . The Kentucky senator will be doing little more than dotting the final \u201c i \u201d ( as in , it \u2019 s official ) in a long-telegraphed campaign for the White House that began four years ago in the first moments after Paul was sworn in as senator .\n\u201c Within the first year of the Senate term , he really started to focus on it , \u201d said a former aide .\nIn fact , the only reason Paul didn \u2019 t run for president in 2012 was that his father , Ron , with whom he shared a Washington apartment and an ideologically fraught mentor-mentee relationship , was considering his third presidential bid . But the father is now retired \u2014 along with the brand of fiery , uncompromising libertarianism Ron Paul became identified with \u2014 and the son believes his time has come to implement the strategy he has been planning for so long .\nThe real groundwork for Rand Paul \u2019 s announcement Tuesday started in a Capitol Hill townhouse just days after the November 2012 election .\nMitt Romney had just lost . Republicans failed to recapture control of the Senate . And Barack Obama was preparing for four more years .\nThe freshman senator closeted himself with about 10 people \u2014 Rand \u2019 s brain trust \u2014 at the home of Rex Elsass , his ad man , and divulged his ambitions . Attendees included Debbie Hopper , a longtime ally of Paul \u2019 s father , and top political aide Doug Stafford . The main topic was how to support legislative proposals aimed at showcasing what Paul still believes is his biggest attribute : His uniqueness .\nAnother part of the discussion focused on ensuring an infrastructure was developed in key early primary states . Paul viewed his dad \u2019 s 2012 presidential campaign as an opportunity to expand his base , campaigning hard for him in Iowa and New Hampshire .\nJesse Benton , who served as communications director for Ron Paul \u2019 s presidential campaign in 2008 , and manager of his 2012 campaign , said that Rand demonstrated his political precocity way back in 2007 , as the campaign struggled . The younger Paul had a lot of ideas about how the elder Paul \u2019 s campaign could be better run \u00adand injected them into the campaign through Benton .\n\u201c Rand and I would talk fairly regularly , \u201d Benton recalled . \u201c I liked a lot of his ideas . I made them better , and then pitched them around the campaign. \u201d Most had to do with \u201c media hand-to-hand combat . \u201d\nBut later on , Rand Paul also knew that he could never win simply as Ron Paul \u2019 s son . After Romney was nominated in 2012 , Rand Paul stayed on the campaign trail . He used his political action committee to attack Sen. Joe Manchin , after the West Virginia Democrat voted against Rand Paul \u2019 s controversial plan to withhold foreign aid . And Paul actively sought to help Romney , even speaking before the Republican National Convention in Tampa , Florida , at a time when his father \u2019 s faltering campaign was squabbling with Romney \u2019 s team about seating some Ron Paul delegates .\nAll these moves by the younger Paul were viewed as a clear attempt to broaden his appeal beyond his father \u2019 s base . And by waiting until the 2016 cycle , he was able to nurture relationships throughout Washington on both the right and the left . He had meals with conservative intellectuals like Stephen Moore , broke bread with Al Sharpton and Cory Booker , and even lent his expertise as an ophthalmologist to give Harry Reid advice on his injured eye .\nYet despite his efforts to win over the GOP establishment and move to the middle , Paul continued to believe that his biggest advantage was that he had stood apart , even among the GOP . There was the sharply conservative budget he proposed in 2011 to cut $ 500 billion in just one year , five times more than the House Republican plan . There was the furious effort to slash foreign aid to Egypt , Libya and Pakistan . And then there was his failed attempt in 2011 to filibuster a four-year extension of the PATRIOT Act .\nPaul knew he needed to do more , however . So as they sat down at the meeting at Elsass \u2019 townhouse in 2012 , the group brainstormed about ways to continue to broaden his appeal so that in 2016 he would be able to break through a contested GOP presidential primary .\nPaul wanted to show that his kind of conservatism could appeal in purple and blue states , discussing issues like criminal justice reform , economic freedom zones in poor urban areas like Detroit , a more moderate plan to handle illegal immigrants and to continue to push his views for a less aggressive foreign policy .\n\u201c The underlining tenor of all of it was : How do we position him for 2016 ? \u201d one attendee said of the meeting .\nAll those plans began to jell in May 2013 during 13 fateful hours on the Senate floor , when Paul filibustered the nomination of John Brennan to be CIA director by launching a crusade against the United States \u2019 policy on the use of unmanned military drones . Americans , he contended , should not be targeted by drones on U.S. soil .\nIt was an argument few politicians wanted to quibble with , other than staunch defense hawks like Lindsey Graham and John McCain . But Paul suddenly was able to inject \u2014 at least for a time \u2014 his brand of libertarianism into the political mainstream in a way few other politicians could . With anti-government sentiment high in the wake of the Edward Snowden \u2019 s disclosures about surveillance and national weariness after the long and bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan even liberals were attracted to Paul \u2019 s rhetoric . He was immediately dubbed a 2016 front-runner .\n\u201c If there was a moment , that was it , \u201d said one of Paul \u2019 s confidants .\nIn 2014 , Paul further tried to broaden his appeal by making a special push to help reelect Mitch McConnell who was facing a tough challenge from a tea party candidate . Paul was in heavy demand on the campaign trail in key Senate races . But he was unable to help flip the Kentucky Statehouse ; as a result , he will have to perform some legal maneuvering to ensure Kentucky law won \u2019 t prevent him from running for the Senate and president at the same time . McConnell has been extremely skeptical about Paul \u2019 s plan .\nHis brain trust gathered once again at the Liaison Hotel in Washington , but this time the meeting was much more serious \u2014 and specific . Message mavens were brought in to sharpen Paul \u2019 s pitch ; finance operatives to discuss a plan to raise millions of dollars to help Paul \u2019 s campaign ; and there were discussions about a Paul super PAC ; and grass-roots operatives who would be courting conservative activists .\nThe idea , however , was still the same : Paul must sell his unique brand as a libertarian-minded conservative with appeal to younger voters , making him a far more attractive candidate than the rest of the field . Along the way , Paul and his advisers mapped out a plan to articulate a message geared toward a more inclusive Republican Party , and to rid himself of any taint of racism or isolationism that might have attached to the libertarian label . On criminal justice , privacy , intrusive surveillance and other issues , he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this year , he is seeking to become part of \u201c a right-left continuum where right and left are coming together . \u201d\nPaul had been sounding this message as far back as an April 2013 speech at Howard University where Paul declared himself and his party to be a friend to the African-American community .\n\u201c Republicans are often miscast as uncaring or condemning of kids who make bad choices . I , for one , plan to change that , \u201d Paul said . \u201c I am working with Democratic senators to make sure that kids who make bad decisions such as nonviolent possession of drugs are not imprisoned for lengthy sentences . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c Because Republicans believe that the federal government is limited in its function \u2014 some have concluded that Republicans are somehow inherently insensitive to minority rights . Nothing could be further from the truth . \u201d\nOver the past six weeks or so , Paul \u2019 s advisers have sought to promote the image of a candidate who has left behind his father \u2019 s military isolationism and is strong on defense .\nIn late March , Rand pushed a pro-defense spending bill \u2014 a departure from his previous support of Pentagon cuts . His advisers have also scheduled him for a richly symbolic campaign event on Thursday in South Carolina \u2014 on the deck of the World War II-era aircraft carrier the USS Yorktown .\nRand campaign insiders are betting that he \u2019 s going to come under sharp attack for his views on defense , and they \u2019 re girding for that . Many of them are convinced that Graham is getting into the race solely to be a Rand instigator and to go after him in debates . ( Taking his cue , Graham gibed on \u201c Face the Nation \u201d on Sunday that when it came to the Iran nuclear deal , \u201c I think everybody on our side , except maybe Rand Paul , could do better . \u201d )\nIn a speech last October , Paul sought to portray himself and his new approach to conservative realism as \u201c a return to traditional Republican values that recognize our limits and realize our might. \u201d As he has done for months , Paul sought to straddle the gulf between neoconservative hawks and neo-isolationist libertarians that has come to define the Republican spectrum . While he said that Americans \u201c don \u2019 t yearn for war , \u201d he also had rare words of praise for an unusually interventionist president , George W. Bush , who Paul noted \u201c successfully brokered 14 new free-trade agreements and negotiated three others that are the only new free-trade agreements approved since President Obama took office . \u201d\nStill , Paul has a long way to go in escaping his purist libertarian past , which has led other GOP candidates like Ted Cruz to paint him as an extremist . In a lengthy profile last year , Sam Tanenhaus of The New York Times noted that \u201c tucked into \u201d Paul \u2019 s famous filibuster were references to a 19th-century law and a Supreme Court ruling restricting government power that served as dog-whistle signals to libertarians that he still has the faith .\nEither way Paul still has months before the primaries to redefine himself , and he \u2019 s all in \u2014 and so apparently is his family .\nWhile Paul has wanted to run for president since becoming a senator , his wife , Kelley , has been more skeptical . She has worried about the spotlight the campaign would place on her family and their three boys . And she was furious at the media coverage in the 2010 Senate race over pranks Paul pulled as a college kid at Baylor , something she feared would grow much worse during a presidential run .\nBut Paul has said repeatedly that he would run only if his wife is on board , and it appears she is .\nPerhaps that trip to the Dead Sea was a sign . Nate Morris , Paul \u2019 s traveling companion , said the water was cold and he didn \u2019 t want to swim . But Paul and his wife , he said , both jumped in .",

But the father is now retired \u2014 along with the brand of fiery, uncompromising libertarianism Ron Paul became identified with \u2014 and the son believes his time has come to implement the strategy he has been planning for so long.\n\nThe real groundwork for Rand Paul\u2019s announcement Tuesday started in a Capitol Hill townhouse just days after the November 2012 election.\n\nMitt Romney had just lost. Republicans failed to recapture control of the Senate. And Barack Obama was preparing for four more years.\n\nThe freshman senator closeted himself with about 10 people \u2014 Rand\u2019s brain trust \u2014 at the home of Rex Elsass, his ad man, and divulged his ambitions. Attendees included Debbie Hopper, a longtime ally of Paul\u2019s father, and top political aide Doug Stafford. The main topic was how to support legislative proposals aimed at showcasing what Paul still believes is his biggest attribute: His uniqueness.\n\nAnother part of the discussion focused on ensuring an infrastructure was developed in key early primary states. Paul viewed his dad\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign as an opportunity to expand his base, campaigning hard for him in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nJesse Benton, who served as communications director for Ron Paul\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008, and manager of his 2012 campaign, said that Rand demonstrated his political precocity way back in 2007, as the campaign struggled. The younger Paul had a lot of ideas about how the elder Paul\u2019s campaign could be better run \u00adand injected them into the campaign through Benton.\n\n\u201cRand and I would talk fairly regularly,\u201d Benton recalled. \u201cI liked a lot of his ideas. I made them better, and then pitched them around the campaign.\u201d Most had to do with \u201cmedia hand-to-hand combat.\u201d\n\nBut later on, Rand Paul also knew that he could never win simply as Ron Paul\u2019s son. After Romney was nominated in 2012, Rand Paul stayed on the campaign trail. He used his political action committee to attack Sen. Joe Manchin, after the West Virginia Democrat voted against Rand Paul\u2019s controversial plan to withhold foreign aid. And Paul actively sought to help Romney, even speaking before the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, at a time when his father\u2019s faltering campaign was squabbling with Romney\u2019s team about seating some Ron Paul delegates.\n\nAll these moves by the younger Paul were viewed as a clear attempt to broaden his appeal beyond his father\u2019s base. And by waiting until the 2016 cycle, he was able to nurture relationships throughout Washington on both the right and the left. He had meals with conservative intellectuals like Stephen Moore, broke bread with Al Sharpton and Cory Booker, and even lent his expertise as an ophthalmologist to give Harry Reid advice on his injured eye.\n\nYet despite his efforts to win over the GOP establishment and move to the middle, Paul continued to believe that his biggest advantage was that he had stood apart, even among the GOP. There was the sharply conservative budget he proposed in 2011 to cut $500 billion in just one year, five times more than the House Republican plan. There was the furious effort to slash foreign aid to Egypt, Libya and Pakistan. And then there was his failed attempt in 2011 to filibuster a four-year extension of the PATRIOT Act.\n\nPaul knew he needed to do more, however. So as they sat down at the meeting at Elsass\u2019 townhouse in 2012, the group brainstormed about ways to continue to broaden his appeal so that in 2016 he would be able to break through a contested GOP presidential primary.\n\nPaul wanted to show that his kind of conservatism could appeal in purple and blue states, discussing issues like criminal justice reform, economic freedom zones in poor urban areas like Detroit, a more moderate plan to handle illegal immigrants and to continue to push his views for a less aggressive foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe underlining tenor of all of it was: How do we position him for 2016?\u201d one attendee said of the meeting.\n\nAll those plans began to jell in May 2013 during 13 fateful hours on the Senate floor, when Paul filibustered the nomination of John Brennan to be CIA director by launching a crusade against the United States\u2019 policy on the use of unmanned military drones. Americans, he contended, should not be targeted by drones on U.S. soil.\n\nIt was an argument few politicians wanted to quibble with, other than staunch defense hawks like Lindsey Graham and John McCain. But Paul suddenly was able to inject \u2014 at least for a time \u2014 his brand of libertarianism into the political mainstream in a way few other politicians could. With anti-government sentiment high in the wake of the Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures about surveillance and national weariness after the long and bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan even liberals were attracted to Paul\u2019s rhetoric. He was immediately dubbed a 2016 front-runner.\n\n\u201cIf there was a moment, that was it,\u201d said one of Paul\u2019s confidants.\n\nIn 2014, Paul further tried to broaden his appeal by making a special push to help reelect Mitch McConnell who was facing a tough challenge from a tea party candidate. Paul was in heavy demand on the campaign trail in key Senate races. But he was unable to help flip the Kentucky Statehouse; as a result, he will have to perform some legal maneuvering to ensure Kentucky law won\u2019t prevent him from running for the Senate and president at the same time. McConnell has been extremely skeptical about Paul\u2019s plan.\n\nIn November, Paul\u2019s planning began to get more serious.\n\nHis brain trust gathered once again at the Liaison Hotel in Washington, but this time the meeting was much more serious \u2014 and specific. Message mavens were brought in to sharpen Paul\u2019s pitch; finance operatives to discuss a plan to raise millions of dollars to help Paul\u2019s campaign; and there were discussions about a Paul super PAC; and grass-roots operatives who would be courting conservative activists.\n\nThe idea, however, was still the same: Paul must sell his unique brand as a libertarian-minded conservative with appeal to younger voters, making him a far more attractive candidate than the rest of the field. Along the way, Paul and his advisers mapped out a plan to articulate a message geared toward a more inclusive Republican Party, and to rid himself of any taint of racism or isolationism that might have attached to the libertarian label. On criminal justice, privacy, intrusive surveillance and other issues, he told POLITICO earlier this year, he is seeking to become part of \u201ca right-left continuum where right and left are coming together.\u201d\n\nPaul had been sounding this message as far back as an April 2013 speech at Howard University where Paul declared himself and his party to be a friend to the African-American community.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are often miscast as uncaring or condemning of kids who make bad choices. I, for one, plan to change that,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI am working with Democratic senators to make sure that kids who make bad decisions such as nonviolent possession of drugs are not imprisoned for lengthy sentences.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBecause Republicans believe that the federal government is limited in its function \u2014 some have concluded that Republicans are somehow inherently insensitive to minority rights. Nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nOver the past six weeks or so, Paul\u2019s advisers have sought to promote the image of a candidate who has left behind his father\u2019s military isolationism and is strong on defense.\n\nIn late March, Rand pushed a pro-defense spending bill \u2014 a departure from his previous support of Pentagon cuts. His advisers have also scheduled him for a richly symbolic campaign event on Thursday in South Carolina \u2014 on the deck of the World War II-era aircraft carrier the USS Yorktown.\n\nRand campaign insiders are betting that he\u2019s going to come under sharp attack for his views on defense, and they\u2019re girding for that. Many of them are convinced that Graham is getting into the race solely to be a Rand instigator and to go after him in debates. (Taking his cue, Graham gibed on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that when it came to the Iran nuclear deal, \u201cI think everybody on our side, except maybe Rand Paul, could do better.\u201d)\n\nIn a speech last October, Paul sought to portray himself and his new approach to conservative realism as \u201ca return to traditional Republican values that recognize our limits and realize our might.\u201d As he has done for months, Paul sought to straddle the gulf between neoconservative hawks and neo-isolationist libertarians that has come to define the Republican spectrum. While he said that Americans \u201cdon\u2019t yearn for war,\u201d he also had rare words of praise for an unusually interventionist president, George W. Bush, who Paul noted \u201csuccessfully brokered 14 new free-trade agreements and negotiated three others that are the only new free-trade agreements approved since President Obama took office.\u201d\n\nStill, Paul has a long way to go in escaping his purist libertarian past, which has led other GOP candidates like Ted Cruz to paint him as an extremist. In a lengthy profile last year, Sam Tanenhaus of The New York Times noted that \u201ctucked into\u201d Paul\u2019s famous filibuster were references to a 19th-century law and a Supreme Court ruling restricting government power that served as dog-whistle signals to libertarians that he still has the faith.\n\nEither way Paul still has months before the primaries to redefine himself, and he\u2019s all in \u2014 and so apparently is his family.\n\nWhile Paul has wanted to run for president since becoming a senator, his wife, Kelley, has been more skeptical. She has worried about the spotlight the campaign would place on her family and their three boys. And she was furious at the media coverage in the 2010 Senate race over pranks Paul pulled as a college kid at Baylor, something she feared would grow much worse during a presidential run.\n\nBut Paul has said repeatedly that he would run only if his wife is on board, and it appears she is.\n\n\u201cThe whole family is behind it,\u201d one adviser said.\n\nPerhaps that trip to the Dead Sea was a sign. Nate Morris, Paul\u2019s traveling companion, said the water was cold and he didn\u2019t want to swim. But Paul and his wife, he said, both jumped in.",

Trump faded in the second half after he had proudly refused to practice in full mock debates ahead of that faceoff.\n\nHe now appears headed into Sunday\u2019s debate in St. Louis at Washington University without similar preparation for the town-hall format that could be even more grueling. On the trail, Trump has largely eschewed town halls in favor of large-scale rallies where he now almost exclusively relies upon a teleprompter. He has also, for the most part, avoided media interviews with all but the friendliest national reporters and the local press.\n\nWhen Trump has held anything resembling a town hall \u2014 as he did earlier this week in northern Virginia \u2014 the moderator has typically been a supporter, in that case social conservative leader Tony Perkins, and the crowd is filled with supporters. Trump entered that event in Herndon to a standing ovation. In early September, he\u2019d done a previous event billed as a town hall, and took questions from one of his advisers, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in Virginia.\n\nIt was more of the same on Thursday night in Trump\u2019s last true chance at a dry-run ahead of a debate to be watched by tens of millions of people.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with Sunday,\u201d Trump insisted of his New Hampshire stop. \u201cIt\u2019s like they make you into a child.\u201d\n\nAnd so, after a little more than a half-hour of easy banter and questions (\u201cWhen you become president can you assure us you will clean house?\u201d), Carr wrapped up by hailing Trump as \u201cthe next president.\u201d\n\nThen, he wished Trump luck in the next debate.\n\n",

The electronic files seized in the Pentagon investigation tell the story of the group \u2019 s rise , as seen through the eyes of Centcom , which oversees military operations across the Middle East .\nThe exact content of those documents is unclear and may not become public because so much of the information is classified . But military officials have told Congress that some of those emails and documents may have been deleted before they had to be turned over to investigators , according to a senior congressional official , who requested anonymity to speak about the ongoing inquiry . Current and former officials have separately made similar claims , on condition of anonymity , to The New York Times . Although lawmakers are demanding answers about those claims , it is not clear that the inspector general has been able to verify them .

        "content": "Publicly , Clinton insists she \u2019 s many months away from a decision . Hillary Clinton 's shadow campaign\nEarly last summer in her Georgian-style home near Washington \u2019 s Embassy Row , Hillary Clinton met with a handful of aides for a detailed presentation on preparing for a 2016 presidential campaign .\nThree officials from the Democratic consulting firm Dewey Square Group \u2014 veteran field organizer Michael Whouley , firm founder Charlie Baker and strategist Jill Alper , whose expertise includes voter attitudes toward women candidates \u2014 delivered a dispassionate , numbers-driven assessment . They broke down filing deadlines in certain states , projected how much money Clinton would need to raise and described how field operations have become more sophisticated in the era of Barack Obama .\nThe meeting was organized by Minyon Moore , a longtime Clinton intimate also at Dewey Square who has informally become the potential candidate \u2019 s political eyes and ears of late . Clinton listened closely but said little and made no commitments , according to people familiar with the nearly hourlong gathering . It appears to have been the only formal 2016-related presentation Clinton has been given from anyone outside her immediate circle .\nPublicly , Clinton insists she \u2019 s many months away from a decision about her political future . But a shadow campaign on her behalf has nevertheless been steadily building for the better part of a year \u2014 a quiet , intensifying , improvisational effort to lay the groundwork for another White House bid .\nSome of the activity has the former first lady \u2019 s tacit approval . Some involves outside groups that are operating independently , and at times in competition with one another , to prepare a final career act for the former senator and secretary of state , whose legacy as the most powerful woman in the history of American politics is already secure .\nMore than two dozen people in her orbit interviewed for this article described a virtual campaign in waiting \u2014 a term that itself makes some of Clinton \u2019 s supporters bristle \u2014 consisting of longtime Clinton loyalists as well as people who worked doggedly to elect her onetime rival Obama .\nThere are two spheres of influence . One is made up of more than a dozen Clinton staffers , loyalists and longtime friends whose advice she values the most .\nThe other sphere is more complex . It includes an assortment of super PACs and outside groups , all jockeying to be part of the Clinton movement but operating beyond her immediate direction and control . Still , some of these efforts could become the foundation of an eventual campaign .\nFor all the genuine excitement about the prospect that Clinton , 66 , could shatter the glass ceiling she famously invoked in 2008 , the potential for rancor among these groups is real .\nIn at least one instance last year , two super PACs collided over efforts to get behind a Clinton candidacy \u2014 forcing her allies to intervene .\n\u201c There \u2019 s upside and there \u2019 s risk \u201d to this patchwork of outside forces , said Tad Devine , an unaffiliated strategist who worked on John Kerry \u2019 s 2004 presidential campaign , when Democratic-leaning outside groups often acted at odds with the candidate \u2019 s message .\n\u201c The upside is that people are out there doing valuable and important work for you , \u201d he said . But \u201c in a campaign , when people are acting on your behalf but they \u2019 re not driven by an agreed-upon strategy , then that \u2019 s the risk . \u201d\nHillary Clinton was a few months removed from the State Department when one of her top aides , Huma Abedin , received an alarmed phone call about trouble brewing between two groups looking to help her politically .\n\u201c Ready for Hillary , \u201d the super PAC that was initially billed as a grass-roots effort to channel early energy for Clinton to run , had become a source of frustration , and it was reaching a boiling point . In addition to a moniker that irked some Clinton allies \u2014 they thought it had an air of inevitability that plagued her in the past \u00ad \u2014 the group was making an aggressive play for activists and donors to back their effort .\nAt the same time , Priorities USA , the main super PAC behind Obama in 2012 , was in discussions to reinvent itself as a pro-Hillary Clinton endeavor . That would mean appealing to some of those same supporters . The two groups also had wildly different views of how active to be while Clinton was assessing whether to run .\nThe Priorities official warned Abedin that the situation could become problematic for Clinton if it wasn \u2019 t resolved . The official sought guidance from someone who had the would-be candidate \u2019 s ear .\nThe efforts of pro-Clinton outside groups over the past half-year , and the Clinton allies trying to corral them , reflect a much-changed political landscape since Clinton \u2019 s last run . Back then , super PACs didn \u2019 t exist . Potential candidates who needed campaign prep work done had to set up an exploratory committee or PAC under their own direct control .\nNow super PACs are a must-have political accessory for candidates of all stripes .\nThe groups can raise and spend unlimited sums in support of a candidate and perform key tasks the person isn \u2019 t ready to do . In Clinton \u2019 s case , Priorities will probably line up pledges from big donors . Ready for Hillary is building email lists . And Correct the Record \u2014 launched last year by Clinton-critic-turned-defender David Brock as an offshoot of the super PAC American Bridge \u2014 hits back when Clinton is attacked in the media and tries to define potential rivals like Chris Christie .\nThe outside backers have allowed Clinton to stay out of the political fray for a longer period of time as she makes up her mind about whether to run .\nBut the free-agent entities can also become headaches when they act at cross-purposes \u2014 or in ways a candidate doesn \u2019 t approve of .\nThe call to Abedin , described by several people familiar with the conversation , touched off a larger debate in Clinton \u2019 s circle . Clinton herself was forced to grapple with the run-in between the two groups ; several sources familiar with the discussions said she wanted to keep her team distant from the work of the super PACs to avoid brushing up against rules forbidding coordination . But Clinton made clear to aides that the mess , which in many ways echoed the factionalism of her past , needed to be sorted out .\nIn a series of meetings in Washington and New York , advisers to both groups huddled to address the problem . John Podesta , the former chief of staff to Bill Clinton who recently joined the Obama White House , was among the participants brought in on the Priorities side to help .\nSome suggested trying to force Ready for Hillary to shut down . That idea was rejected out of concern it would prompt negative stories about Clinton forces stomping on the grass roots .\nAnother adviser proposed merging the two super PACs , but that also went nowhere .\nEventually they settled on a solution : Ready for Hillary would focus on collecting and analyzing voter data , accepting donations up to $ 25,000 . Priorities would be the super PAC for mega-donors , working solely on paid advertising .\nReady for Hillary has since won over key people close to Clinton impressed by its efforts like cultivating detailed lists of supporters through social media , which Clinton didn \u2019 t do in 2008 . Among other moves , it brought on Craig Smith , a White House political director for Bill Clinton and friend from his Arkansas days . He gave the aura of an adult in the room to a group created by younger former Clinton staffers .\nMost important is that Moore , whose background is in field organizing , is said to believe in the work the group is doing , as does Baker of Dewey Square , according to several sources . Besides the email list , Ready for Hillary is building a massive , 50-state direct-mail and voter targeting program . In a sign of cooperation , the group rented Clinton \u2019 s supporter list from her old PAC . It also brought on Obama \u2019 s field gurus , Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird , to help build up its efforts , including by supporting local candidates who Clinton backs in this year \u2019 s midterm elections .\nReady for Hillary hopes to make its data available to a 2016 Clinton campaign , and some Clinton allies believe there are a number of young aides and operatives working for the super PAC who could become part of her campaign . The 2008 campaign had many well-documented flaws , but one was the failure to prominently deploy young campaign talent , which flocked to Obama .\n\u201c If you wonder whether Clintonworld has learned our lessons from 2008 , look no further than the work of Ready for Hillary , \u201d said one source supportive of its work .\nIt \u2019 s far from certain the outside group \u2019 s voter data would be welcomed by a Clinton campaign ; it will likely prefer to compile its own . Or , some Clinton associates say , it could choose from any number of outside campaign data firms , including two launched by Obama 2012 veterans after his reelection .\nElsewhere in the constellation of outside groups doing work related to Clinton is EMILY \u2019 s List , led by operative Stephanie Schriock , who is frequently mentioned as a possible Clinton campaign manager . The group , which focuses on electing women and isn \u2019 t a super PAC , is conducting an expansive polling project about attitudes toward female candidates . Correct the Record , the Brock-sponsored rapid response project , is being managed by a Hillary Clinton favorite , Burns Strider , and has her allies \u2019 nod of approval .\n\u201c This effort for Hillary , unprecedented in both its early timing and scope , is a demonstration of the extent to which the Democratic Party is unified behind this potential candidacy , \u201d said one of the organizers .\nTwo of the boldest-faced names to enter the Clinton constellation in 2013 tied their political fortunes to electing Obama in 2008 : Jim Messina , who went on to become a top political hand in the White House and then run Obama \u2019 s reelection , and Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg .\nDespite his late arrival to Obama \u2019 s campaign in 2008 \u2014 he didn \u2019 t come on board until after the bloody primary \u2014 Messina was seen by Clinton aides as carrying a deep grudge from the campaign to the White House . Some Clinton associates suspected he was behind a failed attempt to scuttle two of her top staff picks at State : Capricia Marshall and Philippe Reines .\nBut what Messina lacks in longtime loyalty to Clinton , he makes up for in connections to Obama \u2019 s vast network of donors and activists . That had obvious value to a group like Priorities USA , which early last year was looking to morph from its 2012 version that decimated Mitt Romney with a series of attack ads into a pro-Clinton endeavor for 2016 .\nEarly last year , Messina , who quietly admired Priorities \u2019 work in 2012 , started talking informally to the super PAC about a role . One draw is that working on a super PAC is less of a grind , and certainly more lucrative , than an actual campaign .\nThe discussions went on for months last year , long before news reports in November that he was in serious talks to become a co-chairman of the group . But some Clinton allies have grumbled that Messina \u2019 s swelling list of business clients could potentially embarrass Clinton ; his backers dismiss the complaints as professional jealousy , saying plenty of Clinton advisers have their own potential business conflicts .\nThe White House has its own worries about Messina \u2019 s hoped-for move . One is that it would look like Obama was giving his blessing to the pro-Clinton group as his own vice president , Joe Biden , is weighing a 2016 run . Concern within the administration about ruffling relations with Biden has been serious enough to cause a lengthy delay in signing off on Messina officially joining Priorities , according to two people familiar with the deliberations .\nWhatever role Messina may end up playing in 2016 , the mere fact that most Clinton allies are fine with him being part of a pro-Clinton group signals a rapprochement that began when Obama tapped Clinton as his top diplomat . Messina had informal discussions with some of her aides after 2012 about his view of modern campaigns , and Bill Clinton has publicly admired his work since developing a connection with him last year .\nMessina wasn \u2019 t the only one affiliated with Obama to join the future Clinton army via Priorities . Katzenberg broke with the Clintons in 2008 to back Obama and four years later helped launch Priorities with a $ 2 million check .\n\u201c I hope my donation will draw attention to the amount of money being raised by the extreme right wing and serve as a catalyst for other Democratic donors , \u201d the DreamWorks Animation chief executive told CBS News in April 2012 . The super PAC is now broadly seen as his baby .\nAfter Obama secured four more years , the Democratic rainmaker made clear he was prepared to get behind Clinton financially . With Priorities reinventing itself and Messina getting involved with the group \u2014 Katzenberg and Messina worked together during the 2012 race \u2014 the media mogul has positioned himself as the group \u2019 s ambassador to Hollywood .\nIf all goes as planned , the hope is that Katzenberg and Messina \u2019 s involvement on behalf of Clinton will signal a smooth passage from Obama to Clinton within the party .\n\u201c It reflects the fact that the Obama political infrastructure is seamlessly transitioning to serve as [ Clinton \u2019 s ] political infrastructure , \u201d said California-based political strategist Chris Lehane . \u201c And [ it ] sends a signal to both Obama donors and operatives that it is all right to begin actively supporting the Clinton \u2019 16 effort . \u201d\nDespite the feverish buildup to a Clinton candidacy , some of her closest advisers aren \u2019 t sure she \u2019 ll run \u00ad\u2014 and some don \u2019 t want her to .\nClinton has as clear a path to the nomination as anyone could . But she also bears the scars from her 2008 battle , as do a number of her aides who remember vividly the toll the enterprise took on Clinton and everyone involved . They all want to help her achieve whatever she decides she wants , but they are clear-eyed about another campaign .",

Still, some of these efforts could become the foundation of an eventual campaign.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: How Clinton's fared in the polls)\n\nFor all the genuine excitement about the prospect that Clinton, 66, could shatter the glass ceiling she famously invoked in 2008, the potential for rancor among these groups is real.\n\nIn at least one instance last year, two super PACs collided over efforts to get behind a Clinton candidacy \u2014 forcing her allies to intervene.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s upside and there\u2019s risk\u201d to this patchwork of outside forces, said Tad Devine, an unaffiliated strategist who worked on John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning outside groups often acted at odds with the candidate\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cThe upside is that people are out there doing valuable and important work for you,\u201d he said. But \u201cin a campaign, when people are acting on your behalf but they\u2019re not driven by an agreed-upon strategy, then that\u2019s the risk.\u201d\n\nThe outsiders: friends with headaches\n\nHillary Clinton was a few months removed from the State Department when one of her top aides, Huma Abedin, received an alarmed phone call about trouble brewing between two groups looking to help her politically.\n\n\u201cReady for Hillary,\u201d the super PAC that was initially billed as a grass-roots effort to channel early energy for Clinton to run, had become a source of frustration, and it was reaching a boiling point. In addition to a moniker that irked some Clinton allies \u2014 they thought it had an air of inevitability that plagued her in the past \u00ad \u2014 the group was making an aggressive play for activists and donors to back their effort.\n\n( PHOTOS: Who\u2019s talking about Hillary Clinton 2016?)\n\nAt the same time, Priorities USA, the main super PAC behind Obama in 2012, was in discussions to reinvent itself as a pro-Hillary Clinton endeavor. That would mean appealing to some of those same supporters. The two groups also had wildly different views of how active to be while Clinton was assessing whether to run.\n\nThe Priorities official warned Abedin that the situation could become problematic for Clinton if it wasn\u2019t resolved. The official sought guidance from someone who had the would-be candidate\u2019s ear.\n\nThe efforts of pro-Clinton outside groups over the past half-year, and the Clinton allies trying to corral them, reflect a much-changed political landscape since Clinton\u2019s last run. Back then, super PACs didn\u2019t exist. Potential candidates who needed campaign prep work done had to set up an exploratory committee or PAC under their own direct control.\n\nNow super PACs are a must-have political accessory for candidates of all stripes.\n\nThe groups can raise and spend unlimited sums in support of a candidate and perform key tasks the person isn\u2019t ready to do. In Clinton\u2019s case, Priorities will probably line up pledges from big donors. Ready for Hillary is building email lists. And Correct the Record \u2014 launched last year by Clinton-critic-turned-defender David Brock as an offshoot of the super PAC American Bridge \u2014 hits back when Clinton is attacked in the media and tries to define potential rivals like Chris Christie.\n\n( VIDEO: The Hillary chorus)\n\nThe outside backers have allowed Clinton to stay out of the political fray for a longer period of time as she makes up her mind about whether to run.\n\nBut the free-agent entities can also become headaches when they act at cross-purposes \u2014 or in ways a candidate doesn\u2019t approve of.\n\nA clash of super PACs\n\nThe call to Abedin, described by several people familiar with the conversation, touched off a larger debate in Clinton\u2019s circle. Clinton herself was forced to grapple with the run-in between the two groups; several sources familiar with the discussions said she wanted to keep her team distant from the work of the super PACs to avoid brushing up against rules forbidding coordination. But Clinton made clear to aides that the mess, which in many ways echoed the factionalism of her past, needed to be sorted out.\n\nIn a series of meetings in Washington and New York, advisers to both groups huddled to address the problem. John Podesta, the former chief of staff to Bill Clinton who recently joined the Obama White House, was among the participants brought in on the Priorities side to help.\n\nSome suggested trying to force Ready for Hillary to shut down. That idea was rejected out of concern it would prompt negative stories about Clinton forces stomping on the grass roots.\n\nAnother adviser proposed merging the two super PACs, but that also went nowhere.\n\n( PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton\u2019s world tour, 2009-2012)\n\nEventually they settled on a solution: Ready for Hillary would focus on collecting and analyzing voter data, accepting donations up to $25,000. Priorities would be the super PAC for mega-donors, working solely on paid advertising.\n\nReady for Hillary has since won over key people close to Clinton impressed by its efforts like cultivating detailed lists of supporters through social media, which Clinton didn\u2019t do in 2008. Among other moves, it brought on Craig Smith, a White House political director for Bill Clinton and friend from his Arkansas days. He gave the aura of an adult in the room to a group created by younger former Clinton staffers.\n\nMost important is that Moore, whose background is in field organizing, is said to believe in the work the group is doing, as does Baker of Dewey Square, according to several sources. Besides the email list, Ready for Hillary is building a massive, 50-state direct-mail and voter targeting program. In a sign of cooperation, the group rented Clinton\u2019s supporter list from her old PAC. It also brought on Obama\u2019s field gurus, Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird, to help build up its efforts, including by supporting local candidates who Clinton backs in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nReady for Hillary hopes to make its data available to a 2016 Clinton campaign, and some Clinton allies believe there are a number of young aides and operatives working for the super PAC who could become part of her campaign. The 2008 campaign had many well-documented flaws, but one was the failure to prominently deploy young campaign talent, which flocked to Obama.\n\n\u201cIf you wonder whether Clintonworld has learned our lessons from 2008, look no further than the work of Ready for Hillary,\u201d said one source supportive of its work.\n\nIt\u2019s far from certain the outside group\u2019s voter data would be welcomed by a Clinton campaign; it will likely prefer to compile its own. Or, some Clinton associates say, it could choose from any number of outside campaign data firms, including two launched by Obama 2012 veterans after his reelection.\n\nElsewhere in the constellation of outside groups doing work related to Clinton is EMILY\u2019s List, led by operative Stephanie Schriock, who is frequently mentioned as a possible Clinton campaign manager. The group, which focuses on electing women and isn\u2019t a super PAC, is conducting an expansive polling project about attitudes toward female candidates. Correct the Record, the Brock-sponsored rapid response project, is being managed by a Hillary Clinton favorite, Burns Strider, and has her allies\u2019 nod of approval.\n\n\u201cThis effort for Hillary, unprecedented in both its early timing and scope, is a demonstration of the extent to which the Democratic Party is unified behind this potential candidacy,\u201d said one of the organizers.\n\nFrom Obama \u201808 to Clinton \u201816\n\nTwo of the boldest-faced names to enter the Clinton constellation in 2013 tied their political fortunes to electing Obama in 2008: Jim Messina, who went on to become a top political hand in the White House and then run Obama\u2019s reelection, and Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\n( PHOTOS: Stars line up for Hillary Clinton 2016)\n\nDespite his late arrival to Obama\u2019s campaign in 2008 \u2014 he didn\u2019t come on board until after the bloody primary \u2014 Messina was seen by Clinton aides as carrying a deep grudge from the campaign to the White House. Some Clinton associates suspected he was behind a failed attempt to scuttle two of her top staff picks at State: Capricia Marshall and Philippe Reines.\n\nBut what Messina lacks in longtime loyalty to Clinton, he makes up for in connections to Obama\u2019s vast network of donors and activists. That had obvious value to a group like Priorities USA, which early last year was looking to morph from its 2012 version that decimated Mitt Romney with a series of attack ads into a pro-Clinton endeavor for 2016.\n\nEarly last year, Messina, who quietly admired Priorities\u2019 work in 2012, started talking informally to the super PAC about a role. One draw is that working on a super PAC is less of a grind, and certainly more lucrative, than an actual campaign.\n\nThe discussions went on for months last year, long before news reports in November that he was in serious talks to become a co-chairman of the group. But some Clinton allies have grumbled that Messina\u2019s swelling list of business clients could potentially embarrass Clinton; his backers dismiss the complaints as professional jealousy, saying plenty of Clinton advisers have their own potential business conflicts.\n\n( PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton\u2019s life, career)\n\nThe White House has its own worries about Messina\u2019s hoped-for move. One is that it would look like Obama was giving his blessing to the pro-Clinton group as his own vice president, Joe Biden, is weighing a 2016 run. Concern within the administration about ruffling relations with Biden has been serious enough to cause a lengthy delay in signing off on Messina officially joining Priorities, according to two people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nWhatever role Messina may end up playing in 2016, the mere fact that most Clinton allies are fine with him being part of a pro-Clinton group signals a rapprochement that began when Obama tapped Clinton as his top diplomat. Messina had informal discussions with some of her aides after 2012 about his view of modern campaigns, and Bill Clinton has publicly admired his work since developing a connection with him last year.\n\nMessina wasn\u2019t the only one affiliated with Obama to join the future Clinton army via Priorities. Katzenberg broke with the Clintons in 2008 to back Obama and four years later helped launch Priorities with a $2 million check.\n\n\u201cI hope my donation will draw attention to the amount of money being raised by the extreme right wing and serve as a catalyst for other Democratic donors,\u201d the DreamWorks Animation chief executive told CBS News in April 2012. The super PAC is now broadly seen as his baby.\n\nAfter Obama secured four more years, the Democratic rainmaker made clear he was prepared to get behind Clinton financially. With Priorities reinventing itself and Messina getting involved with the group \u2014 Katzenberg and Messina worked together during the 2012 race \u2014 the media mogul has positioned himself as the group\u2019s ambassador to Hollywood.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the hope is that Katzenberg and Messina\u2019s involvement on behalf of Clinton will signal a smooth passage from Obama to Clinton within the party.\n\n\u201cIt reflects the fact that the Obama political infrastructure is seamlessly transitioning to serve as [Clinton\u2019s] political infrastructure,\u201d said California-based political strategist Chris Lehane. \u201cAnd [it] sends a signal to both Obama donors and operatives that it is all right to begin actively supporting the Clinton \u201916 effort.\u201d\n\nThe don\u2019t-do-it camp\n\nDespite the feverish buildup to a Clinton candidacy, some of her closest advisers aren\u2019t sure she\u2019ll run \u00ad\u2014 and some don\u2019t want her to.\n\nClinton has as clear a path to the nomination as anyone could. But she also bears the scars from her 2008 battle, as do a number of her aides who remember vividly the toll the enterprise took on Clinton and everyone involved. They all want to help her achieve whatever she decides she wants, but they are clear-eyed about another campaign.\n\nFollow @politico",

        "content": "HUALIEN COUNTY , Taiwan \u2014 Thirty years ago , before she dyed her hair pink to cover up the white , Dr. Huei-wen Tien came to Xiulin , a township on the east coast of Taiwan severed from the island \u2019 s urban centers by a formidable mountain range .\nShe had agreed to serve for 10 years in an aboriginal community in exchange for her medical education . Unconventional by nature \u2014 her motorcycle helmet says \u201c Punk \u201d \u2014 Tien says she wanted a challenge . She found one here , where about 15,000 people , mostly of the Taroko tribe , live near the lush gorges of a national park that shares their name .\nDiabetes , alcoholism , and heart disease are common problems among the Taroko . The indigenous people have endured displacement , forced assimilation , and discrimination over the centuries . They are also poorer than the ethnically Han Chinese who make up most of Taiwan \u2019 s population .\nBut they never have to worry about one thing : their health care . In Taiwan , everybody is covered . The Taiwanese health care system is built on the belief that everyone deserves health care , in Xiulin just as much as anywhere else . The costs to patients are minimal . And the government has set up special programs to deliver care to the people in Xiulin and their neighbors in Hualien County .\nOn a warm October afternoon , in a government health clinic in the foothills of the Zhongyang ( Central ) Mountain Range , Tien saw an older Taroko woman she \u2019 s treated for decades . They have a comfortable rapport . The doctor teased the patient for her high blood sugar , asked what she had for breakfast , and insisted the woman take her diabetes medication that she skipped that morning . ( The woman said she was busy . )\nTien then inserted the woman \u2019 s national health insurance card into a chip reader to pull up her medical record on the computer . The cards are ubiquitous in Taiwan , the signature of its single-payer health care system , carried by everyone from the woman in Xiulin to a venture biotech executive I met in Taipei .\nIn the 1990s , Taiwan did what has long been considered impossible in the US : The island of 24 million people took a fractured and inequitable health care system and transformed it into something as close to Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2019 s vision of Medicare-for-all as anything in the world .\nI came here last October to learn what it takes to set up and sustain such a system . It \u2019 s one of several stops around the globe that \u2588\u2588\u2588 made this past fall , in an effort to learn how other countries tried to achieve universal and affordable health care . Our project , Everybody Covered , was made possible by a grant from The Commonwealth Fund .\nThere \u2019 s clearly a need for lessons . Compared to the rest of the developed world , America spends more money on health care and produces worse outcomes . By one advanced metric \u2014 mortality for causes that should be avoidable with accessible , high-quality health care \u2014 the United States ranked last among the G7 countries in 2016 . America \u2019 s infant mortality rate is almost double that of some of its peers . Nearly one in 10 Americans lack insurance . People go bankrupt over medical bills . Yet Americans still spend about twice as much money on health care per capita as the average comparable country .\nNo health care system is perfect . But most of America \u2019 s economic peers have figured out a way to deliver truly universal coverage and quality care . The United States has not .\n\u201c Canada and virtually all European and Asian developed nations have reached , decades ago , a political consensus to treat health care as a social good , \u201d health care economist Uwe Reinhardt wrote in his book Priced Out shortly before his death in 2017 . \u201c By contrast , we in the United States have never reached a politically dominant consensus on the issue . \u201d\nTaiwan made its choice in the 1990s and embraced single-payer . It has required sacrifice : by doctors who believe they \u2019 re forced to see too many patients every day ; by patients with complex and costly conditions who can \u2019 t always access the latest treatments ; by citizens who have been asked from time to time , and will be asked again , to pay more for their health care than they did before .\nThe vast majority of Taiwan \u2019 s citizens today approve of their health care system . They know it isn \u2019 t a utopia . The country has made hard choices to keep this program sustainable , and it will need to do so again . That is what it takes to realize the single-payer dream .\nTaiwan took a broken system and built a new national health insurance program\nIn the 1980s , Taiwan wasn \u2019 t yet a democracy , but the stirrings of popular rule could be felt . At the time , about 40 percent of Taiwanese people lacked health insurance \u2014 some people lost everything , even their house , if they had a medical crisis . Desperate to outflank reformers , the ruling government convened high-profile meetings to fix its health care system .\nOne guest at a 1989 conference was the German-born Reinhardt , a Princeton economist who was married to Taiwan-born scholar Tsung-Mei ( May ) Cheng .\nReinhardt , who later co-wrote the seminal paper \u201c It \u2019 s The Prices , Stupid \u201d about American health care and helped define the health policy debate in the US in the 2000s , was asked what system he thought Taiwan should adopt . He thought it over and talked about it with his wife for a couple of nights in their hotel room .\nEverybody Covered What the US can learn from other countries \u2019 health systems Two sisters . Two different journeys through Australia \u2019 s health care system .\nHe finally delivered his answer : single-payer . One national health insurance plan , run by the government , covering everybody .\nIn Reinhardt \u2019 s view , single-payer would be the most equitable and efficient program . It was similar to systems already in place in Canada and the United Kingdom . He came up with the metaphor of the \u201c single pipe \u201d \u2014 through which all the money for health care would flow \u2014 to convey the concept to public officials .\nIt was a convincing presentation . As Cheng and her husband left to return to the United States , they didn \u2019 t know what would happen next . \u201c We went back to Princeton , \u201d Cheng recalls , \u201c and six months later , we were told the government would accept your recommendation to go single-payer . \u201d\nThe national government would eventually fast-track the implementation of the new system to 1995 , hoping to get the chaotic transition period over before the first popular elections in 1996 . There was plenty of skepticism leading up to it . Industry , experts , and the public alike doubted the program would succeed . Labor protesters threw paper money traditionally used in a funerary rite when the legislature passed the single-payer bill in 1994 . A majority of people in Taiwan disapproved of the single-payer plan when it took effect .\nBut the program \u2019 s reputation quickly improved once people started to enjoy its benefits . Approval has dipped ( when premiums were hiked in the 2000s ) and risen ( when the rural health care program that employs Tien in Xiulin was implemented ) over the years , but there has always been a solid baseline of support . Today , approval of the national health insurance program hovers near its all-time high , over 80 percent . The system endures 25 years after it was established .\nPart of its appeal is its simplicity . Everybody in Taiwan is insured through the National Health Insurance Administration ( NHIA ) . They receive an ID card as proof of coverage , which also stores their medical records . The Taiwanese program runs with extraordinary efficiency : About 1 percent of its funding is spent on administration , according to a 2015 review by Cheng . ( Compare that to the US , where researchers have estimated that private insurers spend around 12 percent of overhead , and hospitals spend around 25 percent on administrative work . ) Experts say Taiwan \u2019 s advanced IT infrastructure deserves a good share of the credit .\nThe benefits are quite comprehensive : hospital care , primary care , prescription drugs , traditional Chinese medicine . Patients must make copays when they visit the doctor or fill a prescription or go to the ER , but they are generally low , 360 NTD ( about $ 12 ) or less . Lower-income patients are given an additional break on their cost-sharing obligations . Higher-income patients can take out private insurance for certain things not covered by the single-payer program .\nThe system is mostly funded by payroll-based premiums , with contributions from workers and their employers , supplemented by more progressive income taxes and tobacco and lottery levies . Premiums have been raised twice in the past 18 years to cover the growing cost of the program . The most recent rate increase in 2010 moved the payroll income tax rate from 4.55 percent to 5.17 , a 14 percent increase .\nIn the early 2000s , again at Reinhardt \u2019 s recommendation , Taiwan converted to global budgets to pay for health care as another cost-control measure . This means that every year , government officials and private providers sit across a table and negotiate rates for services , with an annual cap set on the total payments to hospitals and doctors that the government will make . Health spending has stayed flat in recent years as a percentage of GDP , and it is growing at a slower rate in Taiwan than in the United States .\nTaiwanese patients use a lot of health care , and it puts a strain on providers\nWhat it all adds up to is a system that patients seem broadly happy with \u2014 maybe too happy , according to doctors and economists I met .\n\u201c I believe we are too kind to our patient [ s ] , \u201d says Shou-Hsia Cheng , a health economics professor at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) who has worked at NHIA on and off over the years , \u201c which is not a good thing , actually . \u201d\nTaiwanese people take advantage of their cheap , accessible health care . The average number of physician visits per year ( 12.1 ) is nearly twice that of other developed economies . There was a dramatic spike in use after single-payer was passed : A 1997 JAMA research paper led by Shou-Hsia Cheng found that physician visits among the newly insured doubled in the first year of the program compared to the year before .\nThat has had predictable downsides : Hospitals get crowded in Taiwan . The capacity of health care providers to attend to everyone in need can be stretched pretty thin .\nI visited the National Taiwan University Hospital , a red-brick building in the heart of Taipei from the Japanese colonial period , one weekday afternoon . All of the clinic lobbies were full . The registration desk , run take-a-number style , was bustling , beeps constantly pinging over the PA system as patients \u2019 numbers were called .\nOn another morning , inside a north-central Taipei primary care clinic , several patients were already sitting along the walls , hooked up to machines receiving infrared therapy for chronic pain , just a few minutes after the doors opened . The one doctor on site looked a bit frazzled as he showed me around before his clinic filled up any further .\nThe scenes bring to mind something I heard from trauma surgeon Li-Jian Chien , a member of the Taiwanese doctors union that formed in 2012 out of the frustrations felt in the medical profession .\nIn Taiwan , he says , \u201c the patient [ is ] in heaven \u201d \u2014 but \u201c the doctor is in hell . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s the opposite of the United States , he elaborates , where high cost sharing leads people to skip necessary care for serious conditions .\nChien says national health insurance with negligible cost sharing has pushed doctors to the brink . His friend and fellow physician Bing-Hong Lin exclaimed at one point during our interview : \u201c We are not the Avengers ! \u201d\nSurveys conducted by the government show health care providers have rather mixed opinions on the single-payer system \u2014 a significant plurality , 43 percent , said they were \u201c neutral \u201d in 2018 \u2014 a sharp contrast to the public \u2019 s sky-high favorability .\nChien says he sometimes sees the same patient dozens of times every year in the emergency department where he works , often for problems that aren \u2019 t emergencies . The low costs mean patients have little incentive to avoid the ER .\n\u201c Everyone wants to live forever , but it \u2019 s impossible , \u201d Chien says . \u201c Some people abuse emergency , abuse health care . \u201d\nAt the same time , because Taipei has a lot of traffic accidents , injured drivers and pedestrians come through his emergency department \u2019 s doors all the time . His attention is divided when it shouldn \u2019 t be .\nLin has started doing cosmetic medicine for adults on the side because he has become so frustrated by his pediatric practice . It \u2019 s a more lucrative field , paid for privately by patients , with a less demanding workload . His is not an uncommon choice , according to experts . Lin still bitterly remembers being called back early from leave he had taken in 2005 to attend his father \u2019 s funeral , because there was a staffing shortage at the hospital where he was doing his residency .\nTaiwanese hospitals and clinics are understaffed compared to the rest of the world : There are about 1.7 doctors in Taiwan for every 1,000 patients , which is well below the average of 3.3 in other developed countries . There are especially shortages of specialists in less urbanized parts of the country .\n\u201c Taiwan \u2019 s low ratios would be considered inadequate by OECD standards , \u201d Tsung-Mei Cheng wrote in 2015 , \u201c especially in view of the high utilization of health care services in Taiwan . \u201d\nThe country does excel at keeping wait times short for services like cataract and hip replacement surgeries . But providers are feeling the strain .\nTaiwanese doctors work about 10 more hours a week on average than those in the United States . A 2016 survey of hospital physicians found that working overtime was prevalent , and doctors who worked a lot of overtime were more likely to say they might leave the hospital where they worked .\nCrowded facilities , like the NTU Hospital , are the norm . Hospitals supplement their medical payments with high-margin non-health care services \u2014 food courts , parking , and so on \u2014 to keep themselves solvent .\nThe worry is that Taiwan \u2019 s national health insurance has given patients such a good deal on medical care that they are overwhelming the system .\nPatients must make sacrifices , too , like when a drug is too expensive to cover\nThe patients have their own grievances . They \u2019 ve seen their premiums hiked and more taxes introduced over the past two decades , and they will probably be asked again soon to chip in more money .\nAnd though the benefits are comprehensive for most people , Taiwan still doesn \u2019 t cover everything . Costly treatments for rare conditions are sometimes excluded .\nA new drug for spinal muscular atrophy \u2014 a genetic disorder that progressively breaks down the patient \u2019 s muscle tissue , resulting in early death \u2014 came on the market in the US in 2017 . The first year of treatment costs $ 750,000 . Yi Jie Li , a 25-year-old woman with spinal atrophy and an outspoken advocate who wrote the 2017 book 7,300 Days : The Most Ordinary Luxury , penned a letter to the NHIA pleading with it to cover the drug for the patients it could help .\nThe department replied in a letter , and the president of Taiwan called her on the phone . They said they would do their best . But the drug still isn \u2019 t covered .\nNew medicines sometimes debut in Taiwan a full five years after they came on the market in the United States . For patients who need those medications , every day of waiting is a trial .\n\u201c Now the medicine is there , \u201d Li says , \u201c but you can not use \u201d it .\nIn some rural parts of the country , medical understaffing means less access to specialists and pediatricians . High use has frustrated doctors in the cities , but it \u2019 s patients who suffer if it \u2019 s hard for them to see a doctor or nurse .\nEven though Taiwanese patients get a good deal on health care , they don \u2019 t come across as entitled . Some of the patients I met , including those who have faced the gravest diagnoses , seem acutely aware of the trade-offs demanded of them to keep a single-payer system sustainable .\nGloria Lin was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly before national health insurance took effect ; today she is president of the Taiwanese Cancer Patient Association . Her group plays a part in talks between government and providers about what will be covered ( and for how much ) .\nShe told me that of course she wants to see every new cancer drug covered by the government plan . But she also understands why that \u2019 s impossible : The system would become too expensive .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t want it [ to go ] bankrupt , \u201d she says . \u201c We have to work hand to hand together to solve the problem . \u2026 We have to be sensible for each other . \u201d\nSustaining a single-payer system requires hard choices for patients , providers , and taxpayers\nNational health insurance achieved what the Taiwanese government hoped it would . Everybody can afford health care . People are living longer , healthier lives . But the ever-growing cost of providing health care to everybody makes it challenging for the program to remain financially sustainable .\nThe government keeps having to ask doctors , hospitals , and patients to make sacrifices to keep single-payer running . That \u2019 s not usually a political winner . No elected official is running on a campaign of higher premiums and higher copays .\nBut it helps that national health insurance has proven so popular . People want to make it work because single-payer has clearly improved Taiwanese lives .\nOne metric tells the tale : a rating based on medically amenable mortality , which gives a sense of how often people die of causes for which medical interventions should be available . In 1990 , before Taiwan \u2019 s single-payer program was implemented , the country held a rating around 60 , far behind the United States \u2019 rating of 80 . In 2016 , Taiwan had nearly caught up with the US , topping 85 ; the US sat at 88 , trailing its socioeconomic peers in Europe .\nThere is no doubt that medical care in Taiwan is better under single-payer , though it improved from a much worse status quo than the American system .\nToday , Americans die prematurely of heart disease and lung cancer at higher rates than the Taiwanese . People in Taiwan live a little longer in general , though there are populations that encounter early deaths from alcohol use and stroke , just as some disadvantaged groups do in the United States . Yet overall , Taiwan spends 6 percent of its GDP on health care , about a third of what the United States does .\nThere is no comparison between the Taiwanese system of yesteryear \u2014 a 40 percent uninsured rate and the risk of financial catastrophe \u2014 and the one that exists today .\nIn the early 2000s , with health spending growing too quickly , the national health insurance office decided to institute the global budgets , a set pool of money that would cover all the medical services in a given year .

        "content_original": "HUALIEN COUNTY, Taiwan \u2014 Thirty years ago, before she dyed her hair pink to cover up the white, Dr. Huei-wen Tien came to Xiulin, a township on the east coast of Taiwan severed from the island\u2019s urban centers by a formidable mountain range.\n\nShe had agreed to serve for 10 years in an aboriginal community in exchange for her medical education. Unconventional by nature \u2014 her motorcycle helmet says \u201cPunk\u201d \u2014 Tien says she wanted a challenge. She found one here, where about 15,000 people, mostly of the Taroko tribe, live near the lush gorges of a national park that shares their name.\n\nDiabetes, alcoholism, and heart disease are common problems among the Taroko. The indigenous people have endured displacement, forced assimilation, and discrimination over the centuries. They are also poorer than the ethnically Han Chinese who make up most of Taiwan\u2019s population.\n\nBut they never have to worry about one thing: their health care. In Taiwan, everybody is covered. The Taiwanese health care system is built on the belief that everyone deserves health care, in Xiulin just as much as anywhere else. The costs to patients are minimal. And the government has set up special programs to deliver care to the people in Xiulin and their neighbors in Hualien County.\n\nOn a warm October afternoon, in a government health clinic in the foothills of the Zhongyang (Central) Mountain Range, Tien saw an older Taroko woman she\u2019s treated for decades. They have a comfortable rapport. The doctor teased the patient for her high blood sugar, asked what she had for breakfast, and insisted the woman take her diabetes medication that she skipped that morning. (The woman said she was busy.)\n\nTien then inserted the woman\u2019s national health insurance card into a chip reader to pull up her medical record on the computer. The cards are ubiquitous in Taiwan, the signature of its single-payer health care system, carried by everyone from the woman in Xiulin to a venture biotech executive I met in Taipei.\n\nIn the 1990s, Taiwan did what has long been considered impossible in the US: The island of 24 million people took a fractured and inequitable health care system and transformed it into something as close to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s vision of Medicare-for-all as anything in the world.\n\nI came here last October to learn what it takes to set up and sustain such a system. It\u2019s one of several stops around the globe that Vox made this past fall, in an effort to learn how other countries tried to achieve universal and affordable health care. Our project, Everybody Covered, was made possible by a grant from The Commonwealth Fund.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly a need for lessons. Compared to the rest of the developed world, America spends more money on health care and produces worse outcomes. By one advanced metric \u2014 mortality for causes that should be avoidable with accessible, high-quality health care \u2014 the United States ranked last among the G7 countries in 2016. America\u2019s infant mortality rate is almost double that of some of its peers. Nearly one in 10 Americans lack insurance. People go bankrupt over medical bills. Yet Americans still spend about twice as much money on health care per capita as the average comparable country.\n\nNo health care system is perfect. But most of America\u2019s economic peers have figured out a way to deliver truly universal coverage and quality care. The United States has not.\n\n\u201cCanada and virtually all European and Asian developed nations have reached, decades ago, a political consensus to treat health care as a social good,\u201d health care economist Uwe Reinhardt wrote in his book Priced Out shortly before his death in 2017. \u201cBy contrast, we in the United States have never reached a politically dominant consensus on the issue.\u201d\n\nTaiwan made its choice in the 1990s and embraced single-payer. It has required sacrifice: by doctors who believe they\u2019re forced to see too many patients every day; by patients with complex and costly conditions who can\u2019t always access the latest treatments; by citizens who have been asked from time to time, and will be asked again, to pay more for their health care than they did before.\n\nThe vast majority of Taiwan\u2019s citizens today approve of their health care system. They know it isn\u2019t a utopia. The country has made hard choices to keep this program sustainable, and it will need to do so again. That is what it takes to realize the single-payer dream.\n\nTaiwan took a broken system and built a new national health insurance program\n\nExtraordinary circumstances paved the road to Taiwan\u2019s single-payer system.\n\nIn the 1980s, Taiwan wasn\u2019t yet a democracy, but the stirrings of popular rule could be felt. At the time, about 40 percent of Taiwanese people lacked health insurance \u2014 some people lost everything, even their house, if they had a medical crisis. Desperate to outflank reformers, the ruling government convened high-profile meetings to fix its health care system.\n\nOne guest at a 1989 conference was the German-born Reinhardt, a Princeton economist who was married to Taiwan-born scholar Tsung-Mei (May) Cheng.\n\nReinhardt, who later co-wrote the seminal paper \u201cIt\u2019s The Prices, Stupid\u201d about American health care and helped define the health policy debate in the US in the 2000s, was asked what system he thought Taiwan should adopt. He thought it over and talked about it with his wife for a couple of nights in their hotel room.\n\nEverybody Covered What the US can learn from other countries\u2019 health systems Two sisters. Two different journeys through Australia\u2019s health care system.\n\nNetherlands (coming January 17)\n\nMaryland (coming January 21)\n\nUnited Kingdom (coming January 23)\n\nHe finally delivered his answer: single-payer. One national health insurance plan, run by the government, covering everybody.\n\nIn Reinhardt\u2019s view, single-payer would be the most equitable and efficient program. It was similar to systems already in place in Canada and the United Kingdom. He came up with the metaphor of the \u201csingle pipe\u201d \u2014 through which all the money for health care would flow \u2014 to convey the concept to public officials.\n\nIt was a convincing presentation. As Cheng and her husband left to return to the United States, they didn\u2019t know what would happen next. \u201cWe went back to Princeton,\u201d Cheng recalls, \u201cand six months later, we were told the government would accept your recommendation to go single-payer.\u201d\n\nThe national government would eventually fast-track the implementation of the new system to 1995, hoping to get the chaotic transition period over before the first popular elections in 1996. There was plenty of skepticism leading up to it. Industry, experts, and the public alike doubted the program would succeed. Labor protesters threw paper money traditionally used in a funerary rite when the legislature passed the single-payer bill in 1994. A majority of people in Taiwan disapproved of the single-payer plan when it took effect.\n\nBut the program\u2019s reputation quickly improved once people started to enjoy its benefits. Approval has dipped (when premiums were hiked in the 2000s) and risen (when the rural health care program that employs Tien in Xiulin was implemented) over the years, but there has always been a solid baseline of support. Today, approval of the national health insurance program hovers near its all-time high, over 80 percent. The system endures 25 years after it was established.\n\nPart of its appeal is its simplicity. Everybody in Taiwan is insured through the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA). They receive an ID card as proof of coverage, which also stores their medical records. The Taiwanese program runs with extraordinary efficiency: About 1 percent of its funding is spent on administration, according to a 2015 review by Cheng. (Compare that to the US, where researchers have estimated that private insurers spend around 12 percent of overhead, and hospitals spend around 25 percent on administrative work.) Experts say Taiwan\u2019s advanced IT infrastructure deserves a good share of the credit.\n\nThe benefits are quite comprehensive: hospital care, primary care, prescription drugs, traditional Chinese medicine. Patients must make copays when they visit the doctor or fill a prescription or go to the ER, but they are generally low, 360 NTD (about $12) or less. Lower-income patients are given an additional break on their cost-sharing obligations. Higher-income patients can take out private insurance for certain things not covered by the single-payer program.\n\nThe system is mostly funded by payroll-based premiums, with contributions from workers and their employers, supplemented by more progressive income taxes and tobacco and lottery levies. Premiums have been raised twice in the past 18 years to cover the growing cost of the program. The most recent rate increase in 2010 moved the payroll income tax rate from 4.55 percent to 5.17, a 14 percent increase.\n\nIn the early 2000s, again at Reinhardt\u2019s recommendation, Taiwan converted to global budgets to pay for health care as another cost-control measure. This means that every year, government officials and private providers sit across a table and negotiate rates for services, with an annual cap set on the total payments to hospitals and doctors that the government will make. Health spending has stayed flat in recent years as a percentage of GDP, and it is growing at a slower rate in Taiwan than in the United States.\n\nTaiwanese patients use a lot of health care, and it puts a strain on providers\n\nWhat it all adds up to is a system that patients seem broadly happy with \u2014 maybe too happy, according to doctors and economists I met.\n\n\u201cI believe we are too kind to our patient[s],\u201d says Shou-Hsia Cheng, a health economics professor at National Taiwan University (NTU) who has worked at NHIA on and off over the years, \u201cwhich is not a good thing, actually.\u201d\n\nTaiwanese people take advantage of their cheap, accessible health care. The average number of physician visits per year (12.1) is nearly twice that of other developed economies. There was a dramatic spike in use after single-payer was passed: A 1997 JAMA research paper led by Shou-Hsia Cheng found that physician visits among the newly insured doubled in the first year of the program compared to the year before.\n\nThat has had predictable downsides: Hospitals get crowded in Taiwan. The capacity of health care providers to attend to everyone in need can be stretched pretty thin.\n\nI visited the National Taiwan University Hospital, a red-brick building in the heart of Taipei from the Japanese colonial period, one weekday afternoon. All of the clinic lobbies were full. The registration desk, run take-a-number style, was bustling, beeps constantly pinging over the PA system as patients\u2019 numbers were called.\n\nOn another morning, inside a north-central Taipei primary care clinic, several patients were already sitting along the walls, hooked up to machines receiving infrared therapy for chronic pain, just a few minutes after the doors opened. The one doctor on site looked a bit frazzled as he showed me around before his clinic filled up any further.\n\nThe scenes bring to mind something I heard from trauma surgeon Li-Jian Chien, a member of the Taiwanese doctors union that formed in 2012 out of the frustrations felt in the medical profession.\n\nIn Taiwan, he says, \u201cthe patient [is] in heaven\u201d \u2014 but \u201cthe doctor is in hell.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the opposite of the United States, he elaborates, where high cost sharing leads people to skip necessary care for serious conditions.\n\nChien says national health insurance with negligible cost sharing has pushed doctors to the brink. His friend and fellow physician Bing-Hong Lin exclaimed at one point during our interview: \u201cWe are not the Avengers!\u201d\n\nSurveys conducted by the government show health care providers have rather mixed opinions on the single-payer system \u2014 a significant plurality, 43 percent, said they were \u201cneutral\u201d in 2018 \u2014 a sharp contrast to the public\u2019s sky-high favorability.\n\nChien says he sometimes sees the same patient dozens of times every year in the emergency department where he works, often for problems that aren\u2019t emergencies. The low costs mean patients have little incentive to avoid the ER.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to live forever, but it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Chien says. \u201cSome people abuse emergency, abuse health care.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, because Taipei has a lot of traffic accidents, injured drivers and pedestrians come through his emergency department\u2019s doors all the time. His attention is divided when it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nLin has started doing cosmetic medicine for adults on the side because he has become so frustrated by his pediatric practice. It\u2019s a more lucrative field, paid for privately by patients, with a less demanding workload. His is not an uncommon choice, according to experts. Lin still bitterly remembers being called back early from leave he had taken in 2005 to attend his father\u2019s funeral, because there was a staffing shortage at the hospital where he was doing his residency.\n\nTaiwanese hospitals and clinics are understaffed compared to the rest of the world: There are about 1.7 doctors in Taiwan for every 1,000 patients, which is well below the average of 3.3 in other developed countries. There are especially shortages of specialists in less urbanized parts of the country.\n\n\u201cTaiwan\u2019s low ratios would be considered inadequate by OECD standards,\u201d Tsung-Mei Cheng wrote in 2015, \u201cespecially in view of the high utilization of health care services in Taiwan.\u201d\n\nThe country does excel at keeping wait times short for services like cataract and hip replacement surgeries. But providers are feeling the strain.\n\nTaiwanese doctors work about 10 more hours a week on average than those in the United States. A 2016 survey of hospital physicians found that working overtime was prevalent, and doctors who worked a lot of overtime were more likely to say they might leave the hospital where they worked.\n\nCrowded facilities, like the NTU Hospital, are the norm. Hospitals supplement their medical payments with high-margin non-health care services \u2014 food courts, parking, and so on \u2014 to keep themselves solvent.\n\nThe worry is that Taiwan\u2019s national health insurance has given patients such a good deal on medical care that they are overwhelming the system.\n\nPatients must make sacrifices, too, like when a drug is too expensive to cover\n\nThe patients have their own grievances. They\u2019ve seen their premiums hiked and more taxes introduced over the past two decades, and they will probably be asked again soon to chip in more money.\n\nAnd though the benefits are comprehensive for most people, Taiwan still doesn\u2019t cover everything. Costly treatments for rare conditions are sometimes excluded.\n\nA new drug for spinal muscular atrophy \u2014 a genetic disorder that progressively breaks down the patient\u2019s muscle tissue, resulting in early death \u2014 came on the market in the US in 2017. The first year of treatment costs $750,000. Yi Jie Li, a 25-year-old woman with spinal atrophy and an outspoken advocate who wrote the 2017 book 7,300 Days: The Most Ordinary Luxury, penned a letter to the NHIA pleading with it to cover the drug for the patients it could help.\n\nThe department replied in a letter, and the president of Taiwan called her on the phone. They said they would do their best. But the drug still isn\u2019t covered.\n\nNew medicines sometimes debut in Taiwan a full five years after they came on the market in the United States. For patients who need those medications, every day of waiting is a trial.\n\n\u201cNow the medicine is there,\u201d Li says, \u201cbut you cannot use\u201d it.\n\nIn some rural parts of the country, medical understaffing means less access to specialists and pediatricians. High use has frustrated doctors in the cities, but it\u2019s patients who suffer if it\u2019s hard for them to see a doctor or nurse.\n\nEven though Taiwanese patients get a good deal on health care, they don\u2019t come across as entitled. Some of the patients I met, including those who have faced the gravest diagnoses, seem acutely aware of the trade-offs demanded of them to keep a single-payer system sustainable.\n\nGloria Lin was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly before national health insurance took effect; today she is president of the Taiwanese Cancer Patient Association. Her group plays a part in talks between government and providers about what will be covered (and for how much).\n\nShe told me that of course she wants to see every new cancer drug covered by the government plan. But she also understands why that\u2019s impossible: The system would become too expensive.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want it [to go] bankrupt,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to work hand to hand together to solve the problem. \u2026 We have to be sensible for each other.\u201d\n\nSustaining a single-payer system requires hard choices for patients, providers, and taxpayers\n\nNational health insurance achieved what the Taiwanese government hoped it would. Everybody can afford health care. People are living longer, healthier lives. But the ever-growing cost of providing health care to everybody makes it challenging for the program to remain financially sustainable.\n\nThe government keeps having to ask doctors, hospitals, and patients to make sacrifices to keep single-payer running. That\u2019s not usually a political winner. No elected official is running on a campaign of higher premiums and higher copays.\n\nBut it helps that national health insurance has proven so popular. People want to make it work because single-payer has clearly improved Taiwanese lives.\n\nOne metric tells the tale: a rating based on medically amenable mortality, which gives a sense of how often people die of causes for which medical interventions should be available. In 1990, before Taiwan\u2019s single-payer program was implemented, the country held a rating around 60, far behind the United States\u2019 rating of 80. In 2016, Taiwan had nearly caught up with the US, topping 85; the US sat at 88, trailing its socioeconomic peers in Europe.\n\nThere is no doubt that medical care in Taiwan is better under single-payer, though it improved from a much worse status quo than the American system.\n\nToday, Americans die prematurely of heart disease and lung cancer at higher rates than the Taiwanese. People in Taiwan live a little longer in general, though there are populations that encounter early deaths from alcohol use and stroke, just as some disadvantaged groups do in the United States. Yet overall, Taiwan spends 6 percent of its GDP on health care, about a third of what the United States does.\n\nThere is no comparison between the Taiwanese system of yesteryear \u2014 a 40 percent uninsured rate and the risk of financial catastrophe \u2014 and the one that exists today.\n\nBut hard choices still loom.\n\nIn the early 2000s, with health spending growing too quickly, the national health insurance office decided to institute the global budgets, a set pool of money that would cover all the medical services in a given year. Hong-Jen Chang, then the NHIA director, remembers seeing his effigy being decapitated in protests by hospital supporters. The opposition was overwhelming, and he had to resign over that decision in 2004. That was also shortly after the first premium increase was approved.\n\nNHIA Director-General Dr. Po-Chang Lee told me that, after the presidential election this month, he would pitch the new government on increasing copayments so patients pay more out of pocket if they visit the doctor or hospital.\n\nIt may take more than that. Shou-Hsia Cheng, the NTU professor, predicted Taiwan would soon have to reevaluate its payments for end-of-life care. The country is currently debating how to expand long-term care for an aging population; it\u2019s not covered by the national health plan.\n\nThe financial crunch is coming. The NHIA, which ran surpluses for a while after the last round of rate increases, is now about to see its reserves run out.\n\n\u201cEither we should increase the premium rate or increase the copayment, or we have to delete some coverage items,\u201d Chang, the former NHIA director, says. \u201cThat will happen \u2014 not in two years, perhaps in 10 years. It will happen.\u201d\n\nBut in Taiwan, the need for premium increases or hospital budget caps isn\u2019t considered an indictment of national health insurance, at least if approval ratings for the system are anything to go by. It\u2019s part of the evolution of the system they have built. And because the underlying program is so popular, Taiwanese leaders are confident patients will be willing to do what\u2019s needed to keep single-payer viable.\n\n\u201cThey will adjust,\u201d Cheng, the professor, says. \u201cI believe so.\u201d\n\nTaiwan is realizing the dream of \u201chealth care as a human right\u201d\n\nSince the beginning, the debate in Taiwan has been about balancing the imperatives of equity and access that underpinned the national health insurance program. Perhaps there\u2019s been no greater demonstration of that than seeing the health care system at work in the mountain township of Xiulin, where Tien was making her rounds.\n\nA decade into the single-payer experiment, when Hong-Jen Chang was in charge of NHIA, health care access in places like Xiulin was still lacking. So he decided to start the rural care delivery program that covers Tien and her patients.\n\nOn the same day she treated the Taroko woman at her clinic, Tien ventured out to visit a bedridden stroke patient in his home and showed the same warmth, offering him a cheerful thumbs-up as she went through her exam. A few doors down, a diabetes patient with gout welcomed a nurse into his house, parakeets chirping at the front door, so she could take his blood sugar readings, something she does two or three times a week. Meanwhile, in the town hall, a pop-up Chinese medicine clinic was set up, and patients filed in to get acupuncture treatments.\n\nChang told me a health care delivery program like this was the natural endpoint for the single-payer experiment, a necessary extension of its services to reach a vulnerable population. Without it, the work of Taiwanese health reform would always be incomplete.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the essence of universal health coverage,\u201d he says. \u201cThe principle of health [as a] human right is that everybody regardless of geography, religion, gender, age should have the right to access.\u201d\n\nThe people here seem grateful. Wong Shin-Fa, a 63-year-old Taroko man, stopped me on the side of the road in Xiulin and asked me what I was doing there. When I said I was an American reporting on health care, he told me a story.\n\nHe had a Taroko friend in Los Angeles who broke his arm, he told me, with a government health worker interpreting. Rather than get it fixed in the United States, his friend decided to fly back to Taiwan and have it mended there because he said it would be cheaper.\n\nShin-Fa knew Tien and her shock of pink hair. He said she\u2019s famous around those parts. He told me, \u201cThe government takes good care of the Taroko people.\u201d\n\nByrd Pinkerton contributed reporting to this story.\n\nAshley Pon is an editorial photographer based in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nThe Everybody Covered project can be found at vox.com/covered.

        "authors": "",
        "content": "Fox News is heavily invested in turning Benghazi into the scandal that takes down Barack Obama . It 's not just the dream of brutishly partisan actors like Sean Hannity , but the stated intention of Fox reporters like James Rosen , who told Bill O'Reilly that \u201c there are certain elements ... that are lacking here for this to become Watergate , \u201d among them the self-serving notion that the media -- save for Fox News -- refuse to dig into the \u201c major scandal \u201d that is Benghazi . The idea that media outlets have been reticent to investigate the September 2012 attack on the Benghazi diplomatic compound is laughably false . What Rosen really means is that the press are n't covering it in the way that Fox News is .\nThis plays into the Fox Cycle , a process \u2588\u2588\u2588 has documented by which false and misleading conservative attacks make the transition from right-wing hobbyhorse to national media narrative , with Fox News playing a key role in pressuring mainstream press outlets into covering the story . Fox has been working hard at doing just that this week with a series of segments on Special Report with Bret Baier featuring an anonymous Benghazi \u201c insider \u201d who purports to contradict the official account of the Benghazi attack .\nHere , however , are five instances in which the \u201c insider \u201d describes events that actually took place , were already known , or have been debunked .\n1 . The presence of special forces in Croatia . \u2588\u2588\u2588 documented one such instance of Fox 's confidential informant breaking news that everyone already knew -- the presence of a special operations force in Croatia . \u201c I know for a fact that C-110 [ a special ops team ] , the EUCOM CIF , was doing a training exercise , not in the region of Northern Africa , but in Europe . And they had the ability to react and respond , \u201d said Fox 's unnamed source . Everyone knows that \u201c for a fact \u201d because it 's been a matter of public record for months now and was included in the Pentagon 's official Benghazi timeline . Then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered those forces to deploy , but they could not arrive in time .\n2 . Deployment of those special forces . That brings up another point of contention . Fox 's source claimed : \u201c We had the ability to load out , get on birds , and fly there at a minimum stage . C-110 had the ability to be there , in my opinion , in four to six hours from their European theater to react. \u201d [ emphasis added ] The phrase \u201c in my opinion \u201d is highlighted there because that 's all this is . An opinion . The State Department independent Benghazi review and outside experts have a different opinion : that there were no military assets that could have made it to Benghazi in time to make a difference .

        "content_original": "Fox News is heavily invested in turning Benghazi into the scandal that takes down Barack Obama. It's not just the dream of brutishly partisan actors like Sean Hannity, but the stated intention of Fox reporters like James Rosen, who told Bill O'Reilly that \u201cthere are certain elements...that are lacking here for this to become Watergate,\u201d among them the self-serving notion that the media -- save for Fox News -- refuse to dig into the \u201cmajor scandal\u201d that is Benghazi. The idea that media outlets have been reticent to investigate the September 2012 attack on the Benghazi diplomatic compound is laughably false. What Rosen really means is that the press aren't covering it in the way that Fox News is.\n\nThis plays into the Fox Cycle, a process Media Matters has documented by which false and misleading conservative attacks make the transition from right-wing hobbyhorse to national media narrative, with Fox News playing a key role in pressuring mainstream press outlets into covering the story. Fox has been working hard at doing just that this week with a series of segments on Special Report with Bret Baier featuring an anonymous Benghazi \u201cinsider\u201d who purports to contradict the official account of the Benghazi attack.\n\nHere, however, are five instances in which the \u201cinsider\u201d describes events that actually took place, were already known, or have been debunked.\n\n1. The presence of special forces in Croatia. Media Matters documented one such instance of Fox's confidential informant breaking news that everyone already knew -- the presence of a special operations force in Croatia. \u201cI know for a fact that C-110 [a special ops team], the EUCOM CIF, was doing a training exercise, not in the region of Northern Africa, but in Europe. And they had the ability to react and respond,\u201d said Fox's unnamed source. Everyone knows that \u201cfor a fact\u201d because it's been a matter of public record for months now and was included in the Pentagon's official Benghazi timeline. Then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered those forces to deploy, but they could not arrive in time.\n\n2. Deployment of those special forces. That brings up another point of contention. Fox's source claimed: \u201cWe had the ability to load out, get on birds, and fly there at a minimum stage. C-110 had the ability to be there, in my opinion, in four to six hours from their European theater to react.\u201d [emphasis added] The phrase \u201cin my opinion\u201d is highlighted there because that's all this is. An opinion. The State Department independent Benghazi review and outside experts have a different opinion: that there were no military assets that could have made it to Benghazi in time to make a difference. This is less a contradiction of the official account than a disagreement from a party whose identity and expertise are as yet unknown. (Former Marine officer and special operations team leader Billy Birdzell dismantled Fox's source's claims about the deployment of C-110 here.)\n\n3. Airborne evacuation of survivors. In that same segment, Fox's source said that we should have sent \u201ca quick reaction force that could facilitate their exfil out of the problem situation. [...] If it's an unknown situation, at a minimum, you send forces there to facilitate the exfil or medical injuries. We could have sent a C-130 to Benghazi to provide medical evacuation for the injured.\u201d [emphasis added] According to the State Department report, evacuees and \u201call wounded personnel\u201d were taken out of Benghazi on a chartered jet, with a Libyan C-130 taking \u201cthe remaining U.S. government personnel from Benghazi to Tripoli\u201d :\n\nEvacuees, including all wounded personnel, departed Benghazi on the chartered jet at approximately 0730 local. Embassy Tripoli staff, including the Embassy nurse, met the first evacuation flight at Tripoli International Airport. Wounded personnel were transferred to a local hospital, in exemplary coordination that helped save the lives of two severely injured Americans Embassy Tripoli worked with the Libyan government to have a Libyan Air Force C-130 take the remaining U.S. government personnel from Benghazi to Tripoli. Two American citizen State Department contractors traveled to the airport and linked up with the remaining U.S. government personnel.\n\n4. CIA security team \u201ctook matters into their own hands.\u201d Fox's source is also apparently giving a boost to the network's previous Benghazi \u201cbombshell\u201d -- that CIA personnel had been ordered to \u201cstand down\u201d in response to the Benghazi attacks. Fox News correspondent Adam Housley, who interviewed the unnamed man, reported on April 29:\n\nHOUSLEY: He also says that as the attack began, there were at least 15 special forces and highly skilled state department security staff available in the capital Tripoli who were not dispatched, even though they were trained as a quick response force. Meantime, a group of American reinforcements also in Tripoli, which included the CIA's global response agent, Glen Doherty, and about seven others took matters into their own hands.

Photo taken July 25 , 2018 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Joshua Lott\nSome farmers and farm-state lawmakers , including Trump \u2019 s fellow Republicans , ripped the move , saying they would rather trade with no tariffs than receive government help .\nChina and other top U.S. trade partners zeroed in on American farmers with retaliatory tariffs after the administration imposed duties on Chinese goods as well as steel and aluminum from the European Union , Canada and Mexico .\nFarmers are being targeted since they rely on export markets for agricultural produce and have broadly supported Trump . As the dispute escalates , China and other importers have slapped tariffs on incoming shipments of U.S. soybeans , dairy , meat , produce and liquor .\n\u201c China is targeting our farmers , who they know I love & respect , as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S . They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt .

As the dispute escalates, China and other importers have slapped tariffs on incoming shipments of U.S. soybeans, dairy, meat, produce and liquor.\n\n\u201cChina is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt.

There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it \u2019 s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed \u2014 such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there \u2019 s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But\u2026 \u2018 even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. \u2019 \u2026\n\u201c Here is what a presidential president might have said : If there is one thing the past three years have shown , the only good answer to a foreign country offering dirt on your political opponent is to decline and immediately report the offer to the FBI . Our country is still enduring the fallout from Russian interference in 2016 . It has cast a pall on my presidency and led to the indictment of former senior government and campaign officials . The last thing any president should do is encourage foreign meddling in our next presidential election\u2026 \u201c It is important for me to be clear on this , because it is not only a question of me or my campaign potentially breaking the law . It is also a matter of principle . Our political differences matter less than our commitment to one another as citizens loyal to the same constitutional order and committed to defending it in a world in which other states , friendly or unfriendly , pursue their own national interests . As president , I will defend this principle from the same erosion of other norms we have seen as our politics have gotten sharper. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c Foreign dirt wouldn \u2019 t come from Norway or other stable democratic allies like Ireland , France , and England . It would come from corrupt authoritarian regimes that want to manipulate American democracy for their own ends . In 2016 , the Russian government favored Trump because he appeared open to relieving U.S. sanctions on the country . What if Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies try to repay Trump \u2019 s support as president by meddling in 2020 ? ... What if Chinese leaders try to push the election in his opponents \u2019 favor , in hopes of ending the trade war ? \u2026 Thanks to Trump \u2019 s actions , Americans risk inheriting a democracy where elections are playgrounds for foreign powers rather than an expression of citizens \u2019 wishes. \u201d Matt Ford , New Republic\nRegarding Christopher Steele , a foreign national hired by the Clinton campaign in 2016 , \u201c \u2018 You can pay a foreign national to provide you with services , so a campaign , for instance , could have a campaign attorney who is a Canadian citizen \u2019 \u2026 If this kind of seems like a loophole , experts pointed out that it would be really hard to run a campaign otherwise . It would mean having to worry if the campaign signs you printed came from a foreign company , or if the catering firm you hired had foreign workers . If a campaign is paying someone for work or services , they \u2019 re being compensated . But where that doesn \u2019 t happen , and a campaign is accepting a contribution \u2014 or \u2018 thing of value \u2019 \u2014 from a foreign government , the question then is what \u2019 s in it for them ? \u201d Jen Kirby , Vox\n\u201c When [ White House senior advisor Jared ] Kushner was asked whether he would call the FBI if he received an email offering the Trump campaign help from the Russian government , he refused to answer , saying it was a hypothetical question . Besides , he added , he never received the information he was promised the last time that offer was made . This is like asking someone who stole silverware from your house whether he would steal from you again and him responding it was a hypothetical question and , besides , the silverware he stole the first time turned out to be worthless . It 's unlikely you would invite him over again . However , Donald Trump is running for re-election in 2020. \u201d Larry Noble , CNN\n\u201c Mueller opted not to charge Trump Jr. for accepting a meeting in which he expected to receive opposition research on Clinton and the Democrats from a Russian lawyer in 2016 . But it was not because there was nothing potentially wrong with this ; it was because Mueller decided it was unlikely that it could be proven Trump Jr. knew that it was illegal and/or that the information was something \u2018 of value \u2019 ... [ but ] even if Trump Jr. was ignorant of the law , that defense doesn \u2019 t really fly with his father today \u2014 not after a two-year investigation probing exactly that issue. \u201d Aaron Blake , Washington Post\nThe right argues that the FBI should be notified , but accuses Democrats of double standards regarding foreign contributions to elections .\nThe right argues that the FBI should be notified , but accuses Democrats of double standards regarding foreign contributions to elections .\n\u201c The good thing you can say for President Trump in this interaction is\u2026 that President Trump is the most honest president that we 've ever had . He is . Call him honest Donald . You have Honest Abe and now you can have honest Donald . Why is he the most honest president ? Because President Trump brags about doing all the bad things and thinking all the bad things that all the other presidents have also done but they 've hidden . He 's open about it . He 's honest about it\u2026\n\u201c However , what this also means is then we need to articulate that it 's bad . You do n't want to incentivize foreign governments to spy on American citizens\u2026 You do n't want it to seem like the President of the United States is encouraging you to do that or offering you something in return . That 's not a good idea . It 's refreshing to hear a guy speak honestly but then it 's incumbent on all the rest of us to say right that 's true and that is honest , but we should n't do that . \u201d\nSen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) tweeted , \u201c I believe that it should be practice for all public officials who are contacted by a foreign government with an offer of assistance to their campaign \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 to inform the FBI and reject the offer\u2026 the outrage some of my Democratic colleagues are raising about President Trump \u2019 s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on President Trump \u2019 s campaign and that information , unverified , was apparently used by the FBI to obtain a warrant against an American citizen . \u201d\n\u201c You see , it \u2019 s perfectly fine to pay a foreign spy to use Russian government sources ( including FSB agents ) to put together opposition research on Trump . It \u2019 s also completely acceptable for the DNC to seek out help from Ukraine to come up with dirt on Paul Manafort in order to hurt Trump . But Trump answers a hypothetical honestly instead of choosing to lie like every other politician and it \u2019 s time to clutch the pearls\u2026\n\u201c There \u2019 s no moral , nor legal imperative that if a German ( for example ) offers documented wrongdoing by your opponent , you must immediately turn it over to the FBI and not use it . We live in a global society . Negative information about political candidates comes from all corners and travels far and wide via the internet . This is especially true given how internationally connected and active many Presidential candidates are . If someone does something untoward in a foreign country , it \u2019 s logical that a foreign source would be the one to find out . \u201d\n\u201c If Russia is calling to give the president information about a political opponent , odds are it is making mischief . But what if the call relaying such information comes from , say , Canada ? While it is possible that this could be nefarious , it is more likely that , like a good neighbor , Canada would be trying to warn the president about some peril to American interests\u2026\n\u201c In the 2016 election , Estonia did call President Obama \u2019 s administration to provide opposition research \u2014 specifically , to convey unverified intelligence that Russia might be channeling money into the Trump campaign . The Brits provided information too . So did the Aussies . So , according to former CIA director John Brennan , did a number of European governments . To be sure , these countries are our allies . But that hardly means they were concerned only for our well-being . Like Brennan , they had their own anti-Trump agendas . The foreign-affairs component of Trump \u2019 s populist platform seemed to be : better relations with Putin , NATO bashing , skepticism about American interventions and military commitments , and halting the U.S. taxpayer-funded gravy train for European security . Europeans did not like this , not one little bit . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201c In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",

As president, I will defend this principle from the same erosion of other norms we have seen as our politics have gotten sharper.\u201d Editorial Board, Washington Post\n\n\u201cForeign dirt wouldn\u2019t come from Norway or other stable democratic allies like Ireland, France, and England. It would come from corrupt authoritarian regimes that want to manipulate American democracy for their own ends. In 2016, the Russian government favored Trump because he appeared open to relieving U.S. sanctions on the country. What if Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies try to repay Trump\u2019s support as president by meddling in 2020?... What if Chinese leaders try to push the election in his opponents\u2019 favor, in hopes of ending the trade war?\u2026 Thanks to Trump\u2019s actions, Americans risk inheriting a democracy where elections are playgrounds for foreign powers rather than an expression of citizens\u2019 wishes.\u201d Matt Ford, New Republic\n\nRegarding Christopher Steele, a foreign national hired by the Clinton campaign in 2016, \u201c\u2018You can pay a foreign national to provide you with services, so a campaign, for instance, could have a campaign attorney who is a Canadian citizen\u2019\u2026 If this kind of seems like a loophole, experts pointed out that it would be really hard to run a campaign otherwise. It would mean having to worry if the campaign signs you printed came from a foreign company, or if the catering firm you hired had foreign workers. If a campaign is paying someone for work or services, they\u2019re being compensated. But where that doesn\u2019t happen, and a campaign is accepting a contribution \u2014 or \u2018thing of value\u2019 \u2014 from a foreign government, the question then is what\u2019s in it for them? \u201d Jen Kirby, Vox\n\n\u201cWhen [White House senior advisor Jared] Kushner was asked whether he would call the FBI if he received an email offering the Trump campaign help from the Russian government, he refused to answer, saying it was a hypothetical question. Besides, he added, he never received the information he was promised the last time that offer was made. This is like asking someone who stole silverware from your house whether he would steal from you again and him responding it was a hypothetical question and, besides, the silverware he stole the first time turned out to be worthless. It's unlikely you would invite him over again . However, Donald Trump is running for re-election in 2020.\u201d Larry Noble, CNN\n\n\u201cMueller opted not to charge Trump Jr. for accepting a meeting in which he expected to receive opposition research on Clinton and the Democrats from a Russian lawyer in 2016. But it was not because there was nothing potentially wrong with this; it was because Mueller decided it was unlikely that it could be proven Trump Jr. knew that it was illegal and/or that the information was something \u2018of value\u2019... [but] even if Trump Jr. was ignorant of the law, that defense doesn\u2019t really fly with his father today \u2014 not after a two-year investigation probing exactly that issue.\u201d Aaron Blake, Washington Post\n\nFrom the Right\n\nThe right argues that the FBI should be notified, but accuses Democrats of double standards regarding foreign contributions to elections.\n\nFrom the Right\n\nThe right argues that the FBI should be notified, but accuses Democrats of double standards regarding foreign contributions to elections.\n\n\u201cThe good thing you can say for President Trump in this interaction is\u2026 that President Trump is the most honest president that we've ever had. He is. Call him honest Donald. You have Honest Abe and now you can have honest Donald. Why is he the most honest president? Because President Trump brags about doing all the bad things and thinking all the bad things that all the other presidents have also done but they've hidden. He's open about it. He's honest about it\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, what this also means is then we need to articulate that it's bad. You don't want to incentivize foreign governments to spy on American citizens\u2026 You don't want it to seem like the President of the United States is encouraging you to do that or offering you something in return. That's not a good idea. It's refreshing to hear a guy speak honestly but then it's incumbent on all the rest of us to say right that's true and that is honest, but we shouldn't do that.\u201d\n\nMichael Knowles, Daily Wire\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted, \u201cI believe that it should be practice for all public officials who are contacted by a foreign government with an offer of assistance to their campaign \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 to inform the FBI and reject the offer\u2026 the outrage some of my Democratic colleagues are raising about President Trump\u2019s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on President Trump\u2019s campaign and that information, unverified, was apparently used by the FBI to obtain a warrant against an American citizen.\u201d\n\nLindsey Graham, Twitter\n\n\u201cYou see, it\u2019s perfectly fine to pay a foreign spy to use Russian government sources (including FSB agents) to put together opposition research on Trump. It\u2019s also completely acceptable for the DNC to seek out help from Ukraine to come up with dirt on Paul Manafort in order to hurt Trump. But Trump answers a hypothetical honestly instead of choosing to lie like every other politician and it\u2019s time to clutch the pearls\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no moral, nor legal imperative that if a German (for example) offers documented wrongdoing by your opponent, you must immediately turn it over to the FBI and not use it. We live in a global society. Negative information about political candidates comes from all corners and travels far and wide via the internet. This is especially true given how internationally connected and active many Presidential candidates are. If someone does something untoward in a foreign country, it\u2019s logical that a foreign source would be the one to find out.\u201d\n\nBonchie, RedState\n\n\u201cIf Russia is calling to give the president information about a political opponent, odds are it is making mischief. But what if the call relaying such information comes from, say, Canada? While it is possible that this could be nefarious, it is more likely that, like a good neighbor, Canada would be trying to warn the president about some peril to American interests\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the 2016 election, Estonia did call President Obama\u2019s administration to provide opposition research \u2014 specifically, to convey unverified intelligence that Russia might be channeling money into the Trump campaign. The Brits provided information too. So did the Aussies. So, according to former CIA director John Brennan, did a number of European governments. To be sure, these countries are our allies. But that hardly means they were concerned only for our well-being. Like Brennan, they had their own anti-Trump agendas. The foreign-affairs component of Trump\u2019s populist platform seemed to be: better relations with Putin, NATO bashing, skepticism about American interventions and military commitments, and halting the U.S. taxpayer-funded gravy train for European security. Europeans did not like this, not one little bit.\u201d\n\nAndrew C. McCarthy, National Review\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that \u201cconservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party. In Washington State, voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201cIn Seattle, the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger. In Colorado, voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap, money that the state Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers. In Sussex County, N.J., voters approved, by a 2-to-1 margin, a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (Washington, Colorado, New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately.)\u201d\n\nJim Geraghty, National Review\n\n\u201cIf a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy. In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors?\u2026 the nation does not want another war. How we avoid it, however, is becoming difficult to see. John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing, but his soul is marching on.\u201d\n\nPatrick Buchanan, The American Conservative\n\nOthers note, \u201cI\u2019d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump\u2019s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201cI think Joe Sixpack\u2019s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After all that has emerged about Trump so far, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama\u2019s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack\u2019s attention you are going to have to do better than this.\u201d\n\nKyle Smith, National Review",

Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts .\nTrump wants to \u201c remove or change \u201d a provision of a law known as Section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users .\nTrump said U.S. Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation \u201c immediately \u201d to regulate social media companies .\nOn Wednesday , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported the White House \u2019 s plan to modify Section 230 based on a copy of a draft executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny . The final version of the order released on Thursday had no major changes except the proposal for a federal legislation .\n\u201c What I think we can say is we \u2019 re going to regulate it , \u201d Trump said before the signing of the order .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been called by Democrats that want to do this , so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation , \u201d said Republican Trump , who is running for re-election in November .\nTwitter called the order \u201c a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law \u201d and said attempts to weaken Section 230 would \u201c threaten the future of online speech . \u201d\nA Google spokeswoman said the order would harm \u201c America \u2019 s economy , \u201d while a Facebook spokesman said it would \u201c encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone . \u201d\nThe order , as written , attempts to circumvent Congress and the courts in directing changes to long-established interpretations of Section 230 .

        "content_original": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he will introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that has protected internet companies, including Twitter and Facebook, in an extraordinary attempt to regulate social media platforms where he has been criticized.\n\nThe proposed legislation is part of an executive order Trump signed on Thursday afternoon. Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.\n\nTrump wants to \u201cremove or change\u201d a provision of a law known as Section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users.\n\nTrump said U.S. Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation \u201cimmediately\u201d to regulate social media companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Reuters reported the White House\u2019s plan to modify Section 230 based on a copy of a draft executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny. The final version of the order released on Thursday had no major changes except the proposal for a federal legislation.\n\n\u201cWhat I think we can say is we\u2019re going to regulate it,\u201d Trump said before the signing of the order.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been called by Democrats that want to do this, so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation,\u201d said Republican Trump, who is running for re-election in November.\n\nTwitter called the order \u201ca reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law\u201d and said attempts to weaken Section 230 would \u201cthreaten the future of online speech.\u201d\n\nA Google spokeswoman said the order would harm \u201cAmerica\u2019s economy,\u201d while a Facebook spokesman said it would \u201cencourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.\u201d\n\nThe order, as written, attempts to circumvent Congress and the courts in directing changes to long-established interpretations of Section 230.

        "content": "Transcript : President Obama 's Final State Of The Union Address 58:47\nBelow is President Obama 's final State of the Union address as prepared for delivery .\nMr. Speaker , Mr. Vice President , Members of Congress , my fellow Americans :\nTonight marks the eighth year I 've come here to report on the State of the Union . And for this final one , I 'm going to try to make it shorter . I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa .\nI also understand that because it 's an election season , expectations for what we 'll achieve this year are low . Still , Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families . So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform , and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse . We just might surprise the cynics again .\nBut tonight , I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead . Do n't worry , I 've got plenty , from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients . And I 'll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing . Fixing a broken immigration system . Protecting our kids from gun violence . Equal pay for equal work , paid leave , raising the minimum wage . All these things still matter to hardworking families ; they are still the right thing to do ; and I will not let up until they get done .\nBut for my final address to this chamber , I do n't want to talk just about the next year . I want to focus on the next five years , ten years , and beyond .\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change \u2013 change that 's reshaping the way we live , the way we work , our planet and our place in the world . It 's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs , but also economic disruptions that strain working families . It promises education for girls in the most remote villages , but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away . It 's change that can broaden opportunity , or widen inequality . And whether we like it or not , the pace of this change will only accelerate .\nAmerica has been through big changes before \u2013 wars and depression , the influx of immigrants , workers fighting for a fair deal , and movements to expand civil rights . Each time , there have been those who told us to fear the future ; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change , promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control . And each time , we overcame those fears . We did not , in the words of Lincoln , adhere to the `` dogmas of the quiet past . '' Instead we thought anew , and acted anew . We made change work for us , always extending America 's promise outward , to the next frontier , to more and more people . And because we did \u2013 because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril \u2013 we emerged stronger and better than before .\nWhat was true then can be true now . Our unique strengths as a nation \u2013 our optimism and work ethic , our spirit of discovery and innovation , our diversity and commitment to the rule of law \u2013 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come .\nIn fact , it 's that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible . It 's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations . It 's how we reformed our health care system , and reinvented our energy sector ; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans , and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love .\nBut such progress is not inevitable . It is the result of choices we make together . And we face such choices right now . Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear , turning inward as a nation , and turning against each other as a people ? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are , what we stand for , and the incredible things we can do together ?\nSo let 's talk about the future , and four big questions that we as a country have to answer \u2013 regardless of who the next President is , or who controls the next Congress .\nFirst , how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy ?\nSecond , how do we make technology work for us , and not against us \u2013 especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change ?\nThird , how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman ?\nAnd finally , how can we make our politics reflect what 's best in us , and not what 's worst ?\nLet me start with the economy , and a basic fact : the United States of America , right now , has the strongest , most durable economy in the world . We 're in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history . More than 14 million new jobs ; the strongest two years of job growth since the '90s ; an unemployment rate cut in half . Our auto industry just had its best year ever . Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years . And we 've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters .\nAnyone claiming that America 's economy is in decline is peddling fiction . What is true \u2013 and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious \u2013 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways , changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and have n't let up . Today , technology does n't just replace jobs on the assembly line , but any job where work can be automated . Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere , and face tougher competition . As a result , workers have less leverage for a raise . Companies have less loyalty to their communities . And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top .\nAll these trends have squeezed workers , even when they have jobs ; even when the economy is growing . It 's made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty , harder for young people to start on their careers , and tougher for workers to retire when they want to . And although none of these trends are unique to America , they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot .\nFor the past seven years , our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody . We 've made progress . But we need to make more . And despite all the political arguments we 've had these past few years , there are some areas where Americans broadly agree .\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job . The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start , and together , we 've increased early childhood education , lifted high school graduation rates to new highs , and boosted graduates in fields like engineering . In the coming years , we should build on that progress , by providing Pre-K for all , offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one , and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids .\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American . Because no hardworking student should be stuck in the red . We 've already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower 's income . Now , we 've actually got to cut the cost of college . Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that , and I 'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year .\nOf course , a great education is n't all we need in this new economy . We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security . After all , it 's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job , in the same place , with a health and retirement package , for 30 years , are sitting in this chamber . For everyone else , especially folks in their forties and fifties , saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher . Americans understand that at some point in their careers , they may have to retool and retrain . But they should n't lose what they 've already worked so hard to build .\nThat 's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever ; we should n't weaken them , we should strengthen them . And for Americans short of retirement , basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today . That 's what the Affordable Care Act is all about . It 's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job , or go back to school , or start that new business , we 'll still have coverage . Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far . Health care inflation has slowed . And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law .\nNow , I 'm guessing we wo n't agree on health care anytime soon . But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security . Say a hardworking American loses his job \u2013 we should n't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance ; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that 's ready to hire him . If that new job does n't pay as much , there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills . And even if he 's going from job to job , he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him . That 's the way we make the new economy work better for everyone .\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty . America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up , and I 'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support , like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids .\nBut there are other areas where it 's been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years \u2013 namely what role the government should play in making sure the system 's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations . And here , the American people have a choice to make .\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy . I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed , and there 's red tape that needs to be cut . But after years of record corporate profits , working families wo n't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else ; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered . Food Stamp recipients did n't cause the financial crisis ; recklessness on Wall Street did . Immigrants are n't the reason wages have n't gone up enough ; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns . It 's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts . In this new economy , workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice , not less . The rules should work for them . And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who 've figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders , their customers , and their communities , so that we can spread those best practices across America .\nIn fact , many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative . This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country : how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges ?\nSixty years ago , when the Russians beat us into space , we did n't deny Sputnik was up there . We did n't argue about the science , or shrink our research and development budget . We built a space program almost overnight , and twelve years later , we were walking on the moon .\nThat spirit of discovery is in our DNA . We 're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver . We 're Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride . We 're every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world . And over the past seven years , we 've nurtured that spirit .\nWe 've protected an open internet , and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online . We 've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs , and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day .\nBut we can do so much more . Last year , Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot , America can cure cancer . Last month , he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they 've had in over a decade . Tonight , I 'm announcing a new national effort to get it done . And because he 's gone to the mat for all of us , on so many issues over the past forty years , I 'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control . For the loved ones we 've all lost , for the family we can still save , let 's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all .\nMedical research is critical . We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources .\nLook , if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change , have at it . You 'll be pretty lonely , because you 'll be debating our military , most of America 's business leaders , the majority of the American people , almost the entire scientific community , and 200 nations around the world who agree it 's a problem and intend to solve it .\nBut even if the planet was n't at stake ; even if 2014 was n't the warmest year on record \u2013 until 2015 turned out even hotter \u2013 why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future ?\nSeven years ago , we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history . Here are the results . In fields from Iowa to Texas , wind power is now cheaper than dirtier , conventional power . On rooftops from Arizona to New York , solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills , and employs more Americans than coal \u2013 in jobs that pay better than average . We 're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy \u2013 something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support . Meanwhile , we 've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent , and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth .\nNow we 've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy . Rather than subsidize the past , we should invest in the future \u2013 especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels . That 's why I 'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources , so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet . That way , we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system .\nNone of this will happen overnight , and yes , there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo . But the jobs we 'll create , the money we 'll save , and the planet we 'll preserve \u2013 that 's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve .\nClimate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world . And that 's why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there 's a problem .\nI told you earlier all the talk of America 's economic decline is political hot air . Well , so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker . The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth . Period . It 's not even close . We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined . Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world . No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that 's the path to ruin . Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office , and when it comes to every important international issue , people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead \u2013 they call us .\nAs someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing , I know this is a dangerous time . But that 's not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower . In today 's world , we 're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states . The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation , rooted in conflicts that date back millennia . Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition . Even as their economy contracts , Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria \u2013 states they see slipping away from their orbit . And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality .\nIt 's up to us to help remake that system . And that means we have to set priorities .\nPriority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks . Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people , because in today 's world , even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life , including their own , can do a lot of damage . They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country ; they undermine our allies .\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL , over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands . Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped . But they do not threaten our national existence . That 's the story ISIL wants to tell ; that 's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit . We do n't need to build them up to show that we 're serious , nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world 's largest religions . We just need to call them what they are \u2013 killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out , hunted down , and destroyed .\nThat 's exactly what we are doing . For more than a year , America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL 's financing , disrupt their plots , stop the flow of terrorist fighters , and stamp out their vicious ideology . With nearly 10,000 air strikes , we are taking out their leadership , their oil , their training camps , and their weapons . We are training , arming , and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria .\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war , and wants to send a message to our troops and the world , you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL . Take a vote . But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action , ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them . If you doubt America 's commitment \u2013 or mine \u2013 to see that justice is done , ask Osama bin Laden . Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen , who was taken out last year , or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks , who sits in a prison cell . When you come after Americans , we go after you . It may take time , but we have long memories , and our reach has no limit .\nOur foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda , but it ca n't stop there . For even without ISIL , instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world \u2013 in the Middle East , in Afghanistan and Pakistan , in parts of Central America , Africa and Asia . Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks ; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict , or famine , feeding the next wave of refugees . The world will look to us to help solve these problems , and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians . That may work as a TV sound bite , but it does n't pass muster on the world stage .\nWe also ca n't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis . That 's not leadership ; that 's a recipe for quagmire , spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us . It 's the lesson of Vietnam , of Iraq \u2013 and we should have learned it by now .\nFortunately , there 's a smarter approach , a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power . It says America will always act , alone if necessary , to protect our people and our allies ; but on issues of global concern , we will mobilize the world to work with us , and make sure other countries pull their own weight .\nThat 's our approach to conflicts like Syria , where we 're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace .\nThat 's why we built a global coalition , with sanctions and principled diplomacy , to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran . As we speak , Iran has rolled back its nuclear program , shipped out its uranium stockpile , and the world has avoided another war .\nThat 's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa . Our military , our doctors , and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic .\nThat 's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets , protect workers and the environment , and advance American leadership in Asia . It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America , and supports more good jobs . With TPP , China does n't set the rules in that region , we do . You want to show our strength in this century ? Approve this agreement . Give us the tools to enforce it .\nFifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy , setting us back in Latin America . That 's why we restored diplomatic relations , opened the door to travel and commerce , and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people . You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere ? Recognize that the Cold War is over . Lift the embargo .\nAmerican leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world \u2013 except when we kill terrorists ; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling . Leadership means a wise application of military power , and rallying the world behind causes that are right . It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security , not charity . When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change \u2013 that helps vulnerable countries , but it also protects our children . When we help Ukraine defend its democracy , or Colombia resolve a decades-long war , that strengthens the international order we depend upon . When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick , that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores . Right now , we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS , and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria \u2013 something I 'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year .\nThat 's strength . That 's leadership . And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example . That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo : it 's expensive , it 's unnecessary , and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies .\nThat 's why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion . This is n't a matter of political correctness . It 's a matter of understanding what makes us strong . The world respects us not just for our arsenal ; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith . His Holiness , Pope Francis , told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that `` to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place . '' When politicians insult Muslims , when a mosque is vandalized , or a kid bullied , that does n't make us safer . That 's not telling it like it is . It 's just wrong . It diminishes us in the eyes of the world . It makes it harder to achieve our goals . And it betrays who we are as a country .\n`` We the People . '' Our Constitution begins with those three simple words , words we 've come to recognize mean all the people , not just some ; words that insist we rise and fall together . That brings me to the fourth , and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight .\nThe future we want \u2013 opportunity and security for our families ; a rising standard of living and a sustainable , peaceful planet for our kids \u2013 all that is within our reach . But it will only happen if we work together . It will only happen if we can have rational , constructive debates .\nA better politics does n't mean we have to agree on everything . This is a big country , with different regions and attitudes and interests . That 's one of our strengths , too . Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government , and expected us to argue , just as they did , over the size and shape of government , over commerce and foreign relations , over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security .\nBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens . It does n't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice , or that our political opponents are unpatriotic . Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise ; or when even basic facts are contested , and we listen only to those who agree with us . Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention . Most of all , democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice does n't matter ; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest .\nToo many Americans feel that way right now . It 's one of the few regrets of my presidency \u2013 that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better . There 's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide , and I guarantee I 'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office .\nBut , my fellow Americans , this can not be my task \u2013 or any President 's \u2013 alone . There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation , a more elevated debate in Washington , but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected . I know ; you 've told me . And if we want a better politics , it 's not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President ; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves .\nWe have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters , and not the other way around . We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics , so that a handful of families and hidden interests ca n't bankroll our elections \u2013 and if our existing approach to campaign finance ca n't pass muster in the courts , we need to work together to find a real solution . We 've got to make voting easier , not harder , and modernize it for the way we live now . And over the course of this year , I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do .\nBut I ca n't do these things on my own . Changes in our political process \u2013 in not just who gets elected but how they get elected \u2013 that will only happen when the American people demand it . It will depend on you . That 's what 's meant by a government of , by , and for the people .\nWhat I 'm asking for is hard . It 's easier to be cynical ; to accept that change is n't possible , and politics is hopeless , and to believe that our voices and actions do n't matter . But if we give up now , then we forsake a better future . Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war , or allow another economic disaster , or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought , even died , to secure . As frustration grows , there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes , to scapegoat fellow citizens who do n't look like us , or pray like us , or vote like we do , or share the same background .\nWe ca n't afford to go down that path . It wo n't deliver the economy we want , or the security we want , but most of all , it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world .\nSo , my fellow Americans , whatever you may believe , whether you prefer one party or no party , our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen . To vote . To speak out . To stand up for others , especially the weak , especially the vulnerable , knowing that each of us is only here because somebody , somewhere , stood up for us . To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day .\nIt wo n't be easy . Our brand of democracy is hard . But I can promise that a year from now , when I no longer hold this office , I 'll be right there with you as a citizen \u2013 inspired by those voices of fairness and vision , of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far . Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino , not as gay or straight , immigrant or native born ; not as Democrats or Republicans , but as Americans first , bound by a common creed . Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word \u2013 voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love .\nThey 're out there , those voices . They do n't get a lot of attention , nor do they seek it , but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing .\nI see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours . I see you . I know you 're there . You 're the reason why I have such incredible confidence in our future . Because I see your quiet , sturdy citizenship all the time .\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open , and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board .\nI see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project , and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease .\nI see it in the American who served his time , and dreams of starting over \u2013 and the business owner who gives him that second chance . The protester determined to prove that justice matters , and the young cop walking the beat , treating everybody with respect , doing the brave , quiet work of keeping us safe .\nI see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers , the nurse who tends to him 'til he can run a marathon , and the community that lines up to cheer him on .\nIt 's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is , and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he 's been taught .\nI see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to ; the new citizen who casts his for the first time ; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count , because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth .\nThat 's the America I know . That 's the country we love . Clear-eyed . Big-hearted . Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word . That 's what makes me so hopeful about our future . Because of you . I believe in you . That 's why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong .\nThank you , God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .",

And for this final one, I'm going to try to make it shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.\n\nI also understand that because it's an election season, expectations for what we'll achieve this year are low. Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again.\n\nBut tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don't worry, I've got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I'll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.\n\nBut for my final address to this chamber, I don't want to talk just about the next year. I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond.\n\nI want to focus on our future.\n\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change \u2013 change that's reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world. It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It's change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.\n\nAmerica has been through big changes before \u2013 wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the \"dogmas of the quiet past.\" Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people. And because we did \u2013 because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril \u2013 we emerged stronger and better than before.\n\nWhat was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation \u2013 our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law \u2013 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.\n\nIn fact, it's that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible. It's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. It's how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.\n\nBut such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?\n\nSo let's talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer \u2013 regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.\n\nFirst, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?\n\nSecond, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us \u2013 especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?\n\nThird, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?\n\nAnd finally, how can we make our politics reflect what's best in us, and not what's worst?\n\nLet me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We're in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the '90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.\n\nAnyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. What is true \u2013 and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious \u2013 is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven't let up. Today, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.\n\nAll these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing. It's made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.\n\nFor the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody. We've made progress. But we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments we've had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.\n\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.\n\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower's income. Now, we've actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year.\n\nOf course, a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain. But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build.\n\nThat's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.\n\nNow, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon. But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job \u2013 we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That's the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.\n\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.\n\nBut there are other areas where it's been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years \u2013 namely what role the government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And here, the American people have a choice to make.\n\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there's red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.\n\nIn fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?\n\nSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.\n\nThat spirit of discovery is in our DNA. We're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. We're Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. We're every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world. And over the past seven years, we've nurtured that spirit.\n\nWe've protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.\n\nBut we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade. Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.\n\nMedical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.\n\nLook, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You'll be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it.\n\nBut even if the planet wasn't at stake; even if 2014 wasn't the warmest year on record \u2013 until 2015 turned out even hotter \u2013 why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?\n\nSeven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal \u2013 in jobs that pay better than average. We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy \u2013 something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.\n\nGas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.\n\nNow we've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future \u2013 especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. That's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.\n\nNone of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, and the planet we'll preserve \u2013 that's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.\n\nClimate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that's why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a problem.\n\nI told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It's not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead \u2013 they call us.\n\nAs someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that's not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition. Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria \u2013 states they see slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.\n\nIt's up to us to help remake that system. And that means we have to set priorities.\n\nPriority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies.\n\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That's the story ISIL wants to tell; that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world's largest religions. We just need to call them what they are \u2013 killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.\n\nThat's exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment \u2013 or mine \u2013 to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.\n\nOur foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world \u2013 in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.\n\nWe also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It's the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq \u2013 and we should have learned it by now.\n\nFortunately, there's a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.\n\nThat's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.\n\nThat's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.\n\nThat's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.\n\nThat's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs. With TPP, China doesn't set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.\n\nFifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere? Recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.\n\nAmerican leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world \u2013 except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change \u2013 that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria \u2013 something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.\n\nThat's strength. That's leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo: it's expensive, it's unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.\n\nThat's why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that \"to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\" When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.\n\n\"We the People.\" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together. That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.\n\nThe future we want \u2013 opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids \u2013 all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.\n\nIt will only happen if we fix our politics.\n\nA better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests. That's one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.\n\nBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention. Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.\n\nToo many Americans feel that way right now. It's one of the few regrets of my presidency \u2013 that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.\n\nBut, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task \u2013 or any President's \u2013 alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected. I know; you've told me. And if we want a better politics, it's not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.\n\nWe have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can't bankroll our elections \u2013 and if our existing approach to campaign finance can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution. We've got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.\n\nBut I can't do these things on my own. Changes in our political process \u2013 in not just who gets elected but how they get elected \u2013 that will only happen when the American people demand it. It will depend on you. That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.\n\nWhat I'm asking for is hard. It's easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.\n\nWe can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.\n\nSo, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.\n\nIt won't be easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I'll be right there with you as a citizen \u2013 inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word \u2013 voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.\n\nThey're out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.\n\nI see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you. I know you're there. You're the reason why I have such incredible confidence in our future. Because I see your quiet, sturdy citizenship all the time.\n\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board.\n\nI see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.\n\nI see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting over \u2013 and the business owner who gives him that second chance. The protester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.\n\nI see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him 'til he can run a marathon, and the community that lines up to cheer him on.\n\nIt's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he's been taught.\n\nI see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.\n\nThat's the America I know. That's the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That's what makes me so hopeful about our future. Because of you. I believe in you. That's why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong.\n\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",

That\u2019s 14 times the projected pace of China and driven by Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s discovery of oil.\n\nWorld's Best Growth Guyana's GDP is expected to more than triple within five years Source: IMF\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving from a very low base to a stratospheric leap,\u201d Finance Minister Winston Jordan said in a telephone interview from Georgetown.\n\nSouth America\u2019s only English-speaking nation owes the anticipated windfall to offshore oil deposits discovered in 2015. At the moment, the country doesn\u2019t produce any crude, though its neighbor Venezuela holds the world\u2019s largest reserves.\n\nRead More: Guyana\u2019s First Oil Could Start Flowing as Soon as This Year\n\nWhile Guyana\u2019s $4 billion annual gross domestic product is about a tenth the size of Vermont\u2019s, it will expand to about $15 billion by 2024, according to the IMF.\n\nThe government plans to use some of the money derived from its royalties to build highways to connect coastal towns to the sparsely populated interior, which has gold, diamond and bauxite deposits, Jordan said. The oil sector will represent about 40% of the economy within five years, the IMF calculates.\n\nThe fund says its forecast may be subject to large revisions, since even small changes to the projected oil output in 2020 would result in big swings in the overall economic performance.\n\nSource: Exxon Mobil\n\nExxon has partnered with Hess Corp. and China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd. to develop one of the world\u2019s biggest new deepwater oil discoveries off the country\u2019s coast.\n\nExxon said it will begin pumping from its first well next month, and by 2025 Guyana will produce at least 750,000 barrels a day.\n\nTotal SA, Tullow Oil Plc and Repsol SA are also among the companies exploring for oil in Guyana\u2019s waters.\n\nThe government expects the initial $300 million a year in revenue from profit-sharing and royalties to more than double after a second offshore well starts production around 2022. That money will go directly to a sovereign wealth fund the country established this year, which will be used for \u201cinter-generational\u201d savings, to protect against oil price swings, and to fund development plans, Jordan said.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Kevin Crowley",

        "content": "Hillary Clinton will already make history with her nomination for president , becoming the first woman to lead a major presidential ticket . Now the question is whether she wants to do it again with her choice of running mate .\nClinton is expected to name her vice presidential pick sometime after the Republican National Convention ends and before her own convention begins in Philadelphia on July 25 .\nOn her list are several Hispanic lawmakers , African-Americans and at least one woman .\nLatino politicians like Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro offer an appealing contrast to Donald Trump 's controversial comments on Mexican immigrants , plus he would bring youth to her ticket .\nShe also has a close relationship with Labor Secretary Tom Perez , who is beloved by labor unions .\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren would excite supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . Brown has been a vocal opponent of free trade agreements and is one of the Senate 's most liberal members , while Warren was the original progressive hero who has long railed against Wall Street .\nBut both Brown and Warren , along with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker , have a big complicating factor \u2014 they come from states with Republican governors who would nominate their replacements if the Clinton ticket wins . And with control of the Senate hanging in the balance this November too , losing a Senate seat may be too risky of a gamble for Democrats .\nUltimately though , Clinton may go with a safer , non-historic pick . Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine is a solid choice who was a finalist in President Obama 's search eight years ago . Kaine himself has admitted he is a `` boring '' choice , but boring is n't necessarily a bad thing in politics , and he does come from a swing state too .\nThat 's the same with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , who has emerged as a late , top possible pick for Clinton . The former Iowa governor comes from an important state and is a longtime friend of the Clintons too .\nBelow are some of the potential candidates Clinton 's team is weighing .

In 2008 , President Obama offered him the position of U.S. trade representative , but he turned it down , saying he would have more influence in Congress . Becerra has stumped for Clinton in both English and Spanish and could be a powerful voice for her on issues of immigration .

Booker could energize African-Americans and young voters . But as a freshman senator , his experience will be a question ( even though he has served the same amount of time that Barack Obama did before becoming president ) .

He endorsed President Obama in 2008 ; Obama 's chief strategist , David Axelrod , consulted on Patrick 's 2006 gubernatorial race and later helped in his tough 2010 re-election .

The son of Dominican immigrants , he would help excite the Hispanic electorate . He is also beloved by labor unions \u2014 so much so that they campaigned against his nomination to replace Eric Holder as attorney general in 2014 because they wanted Perez to stay at the Labor Department .

He endorsed President Obama in 2008; Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, consulted on Patrick's 2006 gubernatorial race and later helped in his tough 2010 re-election. While Massachusetts isn't a swing state, Patrick's business and executive experience could be useful as a counterpoint to Trump.\n\nLabor Secretary Tom Perez\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAge: 54 (born Oct. 7, 1961, in Buffalo, N.Y.)

The current secretary of labor was first appointed by Obama as an assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. The son of Dominican immigrants, he would help excite the Hispanic electorate. He is also beloved by labor unions \u2014 so much so that they campaigned against his nomination to replace Eric Holder as attorney general in 2014 because they wanted Perez to stay at the Labor Department. He is less well known than some of Clinton's other possible picks, though, but has been unafraid to attack Trump.\n\nFormer NATO Commander James Stavridis\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAge: 61 (born on February 15, 1955 in West Palm Beach, Fla.)

He spent over thirty years in the Navy and rose to the rank of a 4-star Admiral. For four years, he served as the 16th Supreme Allied Commander at NATO, where he oversaw operations in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, the Balkans, and piracy off the coast of Africa. He is currently the Dean of The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. He has criticized Donald Trump, calling his foreign policy \"naive and dangerous.\"\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAge: 65 (born December 13, 1950 in Pittsburgh, Pa.)

Pleasant, Iowa in 1987. He went on to serve as a state senator and the two-term the governor of Iowa. He's the current Secretary of Agriculture and is the only remaining member of President Obama's original cabinet. Like Kaine, he's a safe pick for Clinton and was already vetted for the vice presidency by John Kerry in 2004. He briefly ran for president in the 2008 cycle but dropped out in early 2007. He endorsed Clinton and served as her national co-chair.\n\nMassachusetts Sen.

She has been a ferocious Trump attack dog, firing back as the presumptive GOP nominee derided her with nicknames such as \"Pocahontas.\" Even before she was elected, she became a hero for progressives after creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and speaking out against Wall Street influence. Many liberal groups urged her to run for president herself this year, but she rebuffed their advances. Now, Warren on the ticket could be an olive branch to Sanders supporters. Others think that an all-woman ticket would alienate some male voters.",

And in the end, the reduction of politics to a pure power struggle with no quarter granted is likely to be won by those who already hold power.\n\nSo let\u2019s try to get a grip and recognize that while the stakes of this and upcoming elections are indeed high and that passionate commitment to politics is an act of civic patriotism, this is not the Spanish Civil War and we should not treat our fellow citizens as cannon fodder or proper objects for a firing squad. Let\u2019s \u201cdemobilize\u201d our rhetoric, please, before it becomes prophetic.",

It \u2019 s a new kind of split between open societies and closed societies . \u201d\nSEBASTIEN BOZON/REUTERS Ms . Le Pen visits a chocolate-maker in Chalezeule in eastern France .\nThe region of undulating hills around Metz is sometimes called the \u201c Country of Three Borders \u201d because it is where France , Germany , and Luxembourg meet . If anyplace can call itself the heart of Europe , it is here . As FN supporters entered the arena for Le Pen \u2019 s rally on a rainy Saturday , the mayor of Metz , Dominique Gros , was hosting a mini ceremony just a few blocks away celebrating Franco-German friendship week .\nMr. Gros \u2019 s father fought in the French Resistance against the Germans . His grandfather died in the epic Battle of Verdun in World War I . His great-great-grandfather fought in the \u00adFranco-Prussian War . Gros himself was born in 1943 , in the middle of World War II . \u201c I learned when I was little that Germany was our enemy , \u201d he says . \u201c But we have succeeded in overcoming our ancestral hate ... and we must fight against this disastrous trend that risks pitting one against the other like in older times . \u201d\nGros is , in other words , a strong advocate of an integrated Europe .\nBut if this region is a story of overcoming animosity through shared interests , it \u2019 s also one of globalization and deindustrialization . It is the disappearance of jobs , and the loss of dignity as a result , that have turned many Metz voters toward Le Pen .\nAt the candidate \u2019 s rally , Camille Ajac says she supports a \u201c Europe of nations \u201d but not the EU , which she calls \u201c a Europe of interdependence. \u201d \u201c We absolutely want to get our sovereignty back , \u201d she says .\nJean Schweitzer , a baby boomer , says he simply wants to give a new party a chance \u201c since neither the right nor left has gotten us anywhere , and meanwhile France just gets worse. \u201d Antoine Dupont talks angrily about his grandmother \u2019 s financial woes . At age 82 , she \u2019 s been reduced to knitting stuffed animals to supplement her pension . He complains , too , that younger people are being forced to leave the country to find higher-paying jobs .\nThey all believe France \u2019 s future depends on the politician whom they describe as frank , simple , and honest \u2013 someone who could be a charismatic next-door neighbor .\nYVES HERMAN/REUTERS Members of the European Parliament in Brussels vote on whether to lift the EU parliamentary immunity of French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen , a sharp critic of the European Union , after she came under investigation for tweeting pictures of Islamic State violence .\nLe Pen promises to hold a referendum on EU membership \u2013 what is called a \u201c Frexit \u201d vote \u2013 if she becomes president . At a rally in Lille , France , in March marking the 60th anniversary of the EU , she said flatly that \u201c the European Union will die , \u201d adding , \u201c the time has come to defeat globalists. \u201d She has called for the reintroduction of a new French currency , though she \u2019 s softened her tone in response to polls showing the vast majority of French want to keep the euro .\nAdvocates of European unity believe France \u2019 s departure from the EU would be catastrophic . \u201c The EU can survive without the [ United Kingdom ] . It wasn \u2019 t there in the first place . It \u2019 s always been sort of half in and half out , \u201d says Douglas Webber , professor of political science at INSEAD , a business school outside Paris . \u201c But if France is no longer there , then basically you are missing not just a foot , you are missing an arm , and a leg , and a good part of the torso . This would be a political ... revolution of the highest magnitude on the Richter scale . \u201d\nLe Pen \u2019 s stance on national identity \u2013 preventing more foreigners from coming in and diluting what it means to be French \u2013 resonates as much as any issue with her followers . It \u2019 s also what makes her sound the most like her father . She wants to reimpose immigration controls at the border . She promises to prevent companies from relocating abroad for cheaper labor .\nWhile detractors criticize her for stirring up hate , pointing often to a statement she made in 2010 comparing Muslims praying in the streets with the Nazi occupation of France , she has tapped into a deep anxiety about radical Islam in France . It has been fed by major terrorist attacks in Paris and Nice that together killed more than 230 people . At the same time , 1.3 million refugees and asylum-seekers , mostly Muslim , have entered Europe in the throes of upheaval in the Middle East , which the far-right easily conflates with terrorism .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s give France back to France , \u201d says Le Pen at the Metz rally .\nAs her followers chant \u201c On est chez nous , \u201d or \u201c We are in our house , \u201d she adds : \u201c What I want is not to close the borders . It is simply to have them \u2013 and control them . \u201d\nFor all her hard-line stances on immigration and the EU , it would be incorrect to classify Le Pen as simply far-right . She has , for instance , adopted a protectionist trade agenda that is increasingly attracting some former socialist and even communist voters .\nOn two other litmus-test issues , gay marriage and abortion , she has toned down her message or remained largely silent . The social conservative branch of the FN seems to be appeased by the voice of Le Pen \u2019 s niece , rising star Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen , who is a devout Roman Catholic and opposed to both . Yet the views of Le Pen herself , born in the pivotal year of 1968 amid student protests to what one family biographer calls a \u201c bourgeois bohemian \u201d mother , remain ambiguous . Her top adviser , Florian Philippot , is gay .\n\u201c Certainly in the \u2019 70s the FN was from the extreme right , but today all the parties that shake European political life , that are creating the surprises ... they are more complex than just a single party from the extreme right , \u201d says Mr. Perrineau .\nIn recent years , Le Pen has also tried to scrub the FN of its darker associations . She has kicked out members who publicly spew the kind of vitriol that was characteristic of her father and attempted to change the party \u2019 s image of being a party of racist old men .\nThe real inflection point came in 2015 . Her father repeated a comment that over the years has refused to fade from memory . Jean-Marie stood by his assertion , first made in 1987 , that the gas chambers of the Holocaust were a mere \u201c detail \u201d in history . Marine banished him from the party and publicly severed their relationship . Many observers have wondered whether the rupture was genuine , or just a brilliant moment of rebranding . Those close to her say it was painful and has been permanent and shows how politics always comes first with the Le Pens .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t break with your father in public on TV and have it not be difficult . It \u2019 s incomprehensible , \u201d says Bertrand Dutheil de la Roch\u00e8re , one of her advisers . \u201c But her father was impossible , just going from provocation to provocation . The FN and Marine don \u2019 t need provocation . \u201d\nHer campaign posters now bear just her first name , not her last , with the words : \u201c In the name of the people. \u201d The logo , now a blue rose , used to be a flame .\nJACQUES BRINON/AP \ufffcFrench far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen ( c. ) and his daughter Marine Le Pen arrive at a ceremony in Paris in 2010 . She broke off ties with her polemical father in 2015 .\nHow much the FN has revamped its image will be tested in the coming elections . Recent polls have Le Pen and 39-year-old centrist Emmanuel Macron , a former investment banker and minister in the ruling Socialist administration , as the front-runners in the first round of balloting on April 23 . Mr. Macron , who broke from the embattled Socialists last year , is running under his own party , En Marche ! , or On the Move .\nIt \u2019 s a wildly unpredictable race . Underdogs won the primaries of the two mainstream parties , the Republicans and the Socialists . Neither one is likely to make it past the first round of voting April 23 to the runoff on May 7 . That means it will come down to the pro-EU , pro-free trade Macron against the antiglobalization , anti-immigrant Le Pen .\nPolls for now give a significant edge to Macron in the second round , but in an era when Mr. Trump and \u201c Brexit \u201d triumphed , no one is predicting an unequivocal defeat for Le Pen .\n\u201c Macron speaks to the France that is doing well , \u201d says Perrineau . \u201c Marine Le Pen speaks to the France that is not doing well . \u201d\nThe steeliness that has helped Le Pen rise to the pinnacle of French politics may be rooted in that cold night in November 1976 when a 44-pound bomb went off in the family \u2019 s Paris apartment building . The explosion damaged 12 dwellings and sent a baby flying out a fifth-floor window . Amazingly , no one was hurt in the incident \u2013 including the child , who landed in a tree along with his mattress . To this day , no one knows who planted the bomb . But Le Pen , who was 8 at the time , has written that she emerged from the incident \u201c no longer a little girl like everyone else . \u201d\nThe youngest of three sisters , Le Pen and her family moved to the wealthy , western suburb of Saint-Cloud to a mansion called Montretout . Today it is tucked within a gated community and carries an air of serenity .\nBut Olivier Beaumont , a French journalist who wrote the book \u201c In the Hell of Montretout , \u201d compares it to the house in Alfred Hitchcock \u2019 s \u201c Psycho , \u201d a place that bore witness to unconventional tragedy , forming Le Pen \u2019 s tough character and ability to rise in politics as an unloved outsider . \u201c Her whole story is one of rupture , departures , doors slamming , \u201d he says .\nThe constant antipathy directed at her father hung over the family . Ultimately her mother , Pierrette , left \u2013 moving out one day when Le Pen was 16 . The distraught teen waited for her mother at the entrance of her high school every day for several weeks , certain she would come home . Instead her mother moved to the United States with a lover , leaking explosive commentary about her ex-husband . At one point , she posed for Playboy magazine . The humiliation was too much for young Marine : She didn \u2019 t talk to her mother again for 15 years .\nLe Pen \u2019 s entree into politics came at age 15 , when her father let her miss school for a week and join him on the campaign trail . Jean-Lin Lacapelle , one of her old friends and an FN official today , says no one at the time saw in her a French president . She didn \u2019 t want the life of a politician .\nInstead it was Marine \u2019 s older sister Marie-Caroline who was expected to take up that mantle , before she and her father had a falling-out and broke ties . Marine , in the meantime , became a lawyer and handled the party \u2019 s legal affairs .\nIn 2002 , Jean-Marie made it to the second round of the presidential elections to face Jacques Chirac , stunning the nation . Marine went on air to talk about it . She was in her early 30s , all smiles and optimism .\n\u201c The day after , at the headquarters of the Front National in Saint-Cloud , all of the press arrived asking , \u2018 Where is Marine Le Pen ? Where is Marine Le Pen ? \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Lacapelle . \u201c It was incredible . \u201d\nHe says that \u2019 s when he knew she would take the party to the top .\nThough older and more polished now , Le Pen still has a blunt , charismatic style that appeals to French youth . The FN is the most popular party in France among people ages 18 to 24 , drawing roughly a third of the social media-savvy demographic .\nPart of her allure is rooted in the plight of young people in the world \u2019 s sixth-largest economy , nearly a quarter of whom are unemployed . On the eve of Le Pen \u2019 s rally in Metz , 20-something supporters from across the country came together in the city \u2019 s party headquarters to discuss their plans for the following day . It had more the feel of an awkward school dance than a strategy session \u2013 they had put out bowls of potato chips and bottles of soda .\nEmilien No\u00e9 , a former Socialist who coordinates the youth movement in the region , says young people are drawn to the FN \u2019 s promise to restore French glory , something they \u2019 ve never known . \u201c A lot of young people are living abroad instead of in France , and this is sad for a country like ours , \u201d he says .\nWhile many Millennials are attracted to Le Pen because they see her as a rebel \u2013 one poster in the FN \u2019 s national headquarters trumpets \u201c The rebel wave \u201d \u2013 the candidate herself doesn \u2019 t act like the icon of a rebellion . In campaign imagery she is more likely to be photographed feeding cows and cuddling kittens .\nWhen she reveals pieces of her personal life , it \u2019 s often in the context of a mother of three children in their late teens . Friends say the twice-divorced politician is a workaholic . But when she does relax , one of her outlets is karaoke . Her choices reveal her era : With her raspy voice , she likes to belt out the songs of Dalida , the Egyptian-born Italian diva who was a global phenomenon from the 1960s into the \u2019 80s .\nLe Pen has made inroads with other voters , too , including women . She doesn \u2019 t carry the feminist mantle . That she would be the first female president of her country is hardly a factor the way it was with Hillary Clinton .\nBut she has positioned herself as a defender of women against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism . She wants the Islamic veil banned , as well as the burkini , saying neither belong in modern French society .\n\u201c We believe that a woman in a veil seems not to be free , \u201d says Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Lacoste Lareymondie , a regional counselor for the FN in the Grand Est .\nShe says women recognize themselves in Le Pen , a divorced single mother . \u201c She is a feminist , of course , \u201d says Ms. Lacoste Lareymondie . \u201c But she represents all kinds of women \u2013 mothers , lawyers , working women , political women . It \u2019 s complete . \u201d\nNot everyone buys it . Critics say her feminism is barely disguised discrimination against Muslims . At some public rallies , protesters denounce her as a \u201c fake feminist . \u201d\nLe Pen \u2019 s mother had two nicknames for Marine growing up : \u201c Miss bonne humeur , \u201d or \u201c Miss good mood , \u201d because of her resolutely joyful and optimistic nature , she writes in \u201c Against the Current. \u201d The other was \u201c Miss Trompe la morte , \u201d or \u201c Miss Daredevil , \u201d because of a fearlessness she showed as a child , whether on a bicycle or skis .\nIn the FN \u2019 s newest campaign video , Le Pen is facing the sea as an emotionally charged soundtrack pounds in the background . It feels like the trailer for a film . In a voice-over , she proclaims her love of France , the \u201c age-old nation that does not submit. \u201d She promises to stand up against the \u201c sufferings of \u201d and \u201c insults to \u201d the country . The video ends with her behind the wheel of a boat , a clear metaphor for one of her main campaign slogans , to steer the country toward what will \u201c put France in order . \u201d\nThe unsubtle subtext is that Paris needs the kind of strong leadership that has been missing under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy before him . The French have always sought a \u201c strongman \u201d in their presidents , a monarchical instinct that turns them toward authority , especially in times of crisis .\n\u201c This is the country that produced Napoleon , the country that produced Charles de Gaulle , \u201d says Perrineau .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nBut he sees protest as the stronger current pushing Le Pen toward the doors of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e . He references French intellectual Pierre Rosanvallon , who said it \u2019 s no longer a time of elections in Western society . It is the time of \u201c dis-elections . \u201d\nIn the end , many French voters , says Perrineau , \u201c just want to vote in the bogeyman . \u201d",

At the same time, 1.3 million refugees and asylum-seekers, mostly Muslim, have entered Europe in the throes of upheaval in the Middle East, which the far-right easily conflates with terrorism.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s give France back to France,\u201d says Le Pen at the Metz rally.\n\nAs her followers chant \u201cOn est chez nous,\u201d or \u201cWe are in our house,\u201d she adds: \u201cWhat I want is not to close the borders. It is simply to have them \u2013 and control them.\u201d\n\nTHOMAS LOHNES/GETTY IMAGES Marine Le Pen (2nd from r.) and other members of right-wing European parties speak to the media during a conference in Koblenz, Germany.\n\nFor all her hard-line stances on immigration and the EU, it would be incorrect to classify Le Pen as simply far-right. She has, for instance, adopted a protectionist trade agenda that is increasingly attracting some former socialist and even communist voters.\n\nOn two other litmus-test issues, gay marriage and abortion, she has toned down her message or remained largely silent. The social conservative branch of the FN seems to be appeased by the voice of Le Pen\u2019s niece, rising star Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, who is a devout Roman Catholic and opposed to both. Yet the views of Le Pen herself, born in the pivotal year of 1968 amid student protests to what one family biographer calls a \u201cbourgeois bohemian\u201d mother, remain ambiguous. Her top adviser, Florian Philippot, is gay.\n\n\u201cCertainly in the \u201970s the FN was from the extreme right, but today all the parties that shake European political life, that are creating the surprises ... they are more complex than just a single party from the extreme right,\u201d says Mr. Perrineau.\n\nIn recent years, Le Pen has also tried to scrub the FN of its darker associations. She has kicked out members who publicly spew the kind of vitriol that was characteristic of her father and attempted to change the party\u2019s image of being a party of racist old men.\n\nThe real inflection point came in 2015. Her father repeated a comment that over the years has refused to fade from memory. Jean-Marie stood by his assertion, first made in 1987, that the gas chambers of the Holocaust were a mere \u201cdetail\u201d in history. Marine banished him from the party and publicly severed their relationship. Many observers have wondered whether the rupture was genuine, or just a brilliant moment of rebranding. Those close to her say it was painful and has been permanent and shows how politics always comes first with the Le Pens.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t break with your father in public on TV and have it not be difficult. It\u2019s incomprehensible,\u201d says Bertrand Dutheil de la Roch\u00e8re, one of her advisers. \u201cBut her father was impossible, just going from provocation to provocation. The FN and Marine don\u2019t need provocation.\u201d\n\nHer campaign posters now bear just her first name, not her last, with the words: \u201cIn the name of the people.\u201d The logo, now a blue rose, used to be a flame.\n\nJACQUES BRINON/AP \ufffcFrench far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (c.) and his daughter Marine Le Pen arrive at a ceremony in Paris in 2010. She broke off ties with her polemical father in 2015.\n\nHow much the FN has revamped its image will be tested in the coming elections. Recent polls have Le Pen and 39-year-old centrist Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker and minister in the ruling Socialist administration, as the front-runners in the first round of balloting on April 23. Mr. Macron, who broke from the embattled Socialists last year, is running under his own party, En Marche!, or On the Move.\n\nIt\u2019s a wildly unpredictable race. Underdogs won the primaries of the two mainstream parties, the Republicans and the Socialists. Neither one is likely to make it past the first round of voting April 23 to the runoff on May 7. That means it will come down to the pro-EU, pro-free trade Macron against the antiglobalization, anti-immigrant Le Pen.\n\nPolls for now give a significant edge to Macron in the second round, but in an era when Mr. Trump and \u201cBrexit\u201d triumphed, no one is predicting an unequivocal defeat for Le Pen.\n\n\u201cMacron speaks to the France that is doing well,\u201d says Perrineau. \u201cMarine Le Pen speaks to the France that is not doing well.\u201d\n\nThe steeliness that has helped Le Pen rise to the pinnacle of French politics may be rooted in that cold night in November 1976 when a 44-pound bomb went off in the family\u2019s Paris apartment building. The explosion damaged 12 dwellings and sent a baby flying out a fifth-floor window. Amazingly, no one was hurt in the incident \u2013 including the child, who landed in a tree along with his mattress. To this day, no one knows who planted the bomb. But Le Pen, who was 8 at the time, has written that she emerged from the incident \u201cno longer a little girl like everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe youngest of three sisters, Le Pen and her family moved to the wealthy, western suburb of Saint-Cloud to a mansion called Montretout. Today it is tucked within a gated community and carries an air of serenity.\n\nBut Olivier Beaumont, a French journalist who wrote the book \u201cIn the Hell of Montretout,\u201d compares it to the house in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho,\u201d a place that bore witness to unconventional tragedy, forming Le Pen\u2019s tough character and ability to rise in politics as an unloved outsider. \u201cHer whole story is one of rupture, departures, doors slamming,\u201d he says.\n\nThe constant antipathy directed at her father hung over the family. Ultimately her mother, Pierrette, left \u2013 moving out one day when Le Pen was 16. The distraught teen waited for her mother at the entrance of her high school every day for several weeks, certain she would come home. Instead her mother moved to the United States with a lover, leaking explosive commentary about her ex-husband. At one point, she posed for Playboy magazine. The humiliation was too much for young Marine: She didn\u2019t talk to her mother again for 15 years.\n\nLe Pen\u2019s entree into politics came at age 15, when her father let her miss school for a week and join him on the campaign trail. Jean-Lin Lacapelle, one of her old friends and an FN official today, says no one at the time saw in her a French president. She didn\u2019t want the life of a politician.\n\nInstead it was Marine\u2019s older sister Marie-Caroline who was expected to take up that mantle, before she and her father had a falling-out and broke ties. Marine, in the meantime, became a lawyer and handled the party\u2019s legal affairs.\n\nIn 2002, Jean-Marie made it to the second round of the presidential elections to face Jacques Chirac, stunning the nation. Marine went on air to talk about it. She was in her early 30s, all smiles and optimism.\n\n\u201cThe day after, at the headquarters of the Front National in Saint-Cloud, all of the press arrived asking, \u2018Where is Marine Le Pen? Where is Marine Le Pen?\u2019 \u201d says Mr. Lacapelle. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d\n\nHe says that\u2019s when he knew she would take the party to the top.\n\nThough older and more polished now, Le Pen still has a blunt, charismatic style that appeals to French youth. The FN is the most popular party in France among people ages 18 to 24, drawing roughly a third of the social media-savvy demographic.\n\nPart of her allure is rooted in the plight of young people in the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, nearly a quarter of whom are unemployed. On the eve of Le Pen\u2019s rally in Metz, 20-something supporters from across the country came together in the city\u2019s party headquarters to discuss their plans for the following day. It had more the feel of an awkward school dance than a strategy session \u2013 they had put out bowls of potato chips and bottles of soda.\n\nEmilien No\u00e9, a former Socialist who coordinates the youth movement in the region, says young people are drawn to the FN\u2019s promise to restore French glory, something they\u2019ve never known. \u201cA lot of young people are living abroad instead of in France, and this is sad for a country like ours,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile many Millennials are attracted to Le Pen because they see her as a rebel \u2013 one poster in the FN\u2019s national headquarters trumpets \u201cThe rebel wave\u201d \u2013 the candidate herself doesn\u2019t act like the icon of a rebellion. In campaign imagery she is more likely to be photographed feeding cows and cuddling kittens.\n\nWhen she reveals pieces of her personal life, it\u2019s often in the context of a mother of three children in their late teens. Friends say the twice-divorced politician is a workaholic. But when she does relax, one of her outlets is karaoke. Her choices reveal her era: With her raspy voice, she likes to belt out the songs of Dalida, the Egyptian-born Italian diva who was a global phenomenon from the 1960s into the \u201980s.\n\nLe Pen has made inroads with other voters, too, including women. She doesn\u2019t carry the feminist mantle. That she would be the first female president of her country is hardly a factor the way it was with Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut she has positioned herself as a defender of women against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. She wants the Islamic veil banned, as well as the burkini, saying neither belong in modern French society.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a woman in a veil seems not to be free,\u201d says Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Lacoste Lareymondie, a regional counselor for the FN in the Grand Est.\n\nShe says women recognize themselves in Le Pen, a divorced single mother. \u201cShe is a feminist, of course,\u201d says Ms. Lacoste Lareymondie. \u201cBut she represents all kinds of women \u2013 mothers, lawyers, working women, political women. It\u2019s complete.\u201d\n\nNot everyone buys it. Critics say her feminism is barely disguised discrimination against Muslims. At some public rallies, protesters denounce her as a \u201cfake feminist.\u201d\n\nLe Pen\u2019s mother had two nicknames for Marine growing up: \u201cMiss bonne humeur,\u201d or \u201cMiss good mood,\u201d because of her resolutely joyful and optimistic nature, she writes in \u201cAgainst the Current.\u201d The other was \u201cMiss Trompe la morte,\u201d or \u201cMiss Daredevil,\u201d because of a fearlessness she showed as a child, whether on a bicycle or skis.\n\nIt\u2019s the intrepidness that seems to rally her base.\n\nIn the FN\u2019s newest campaign video, Le Pen is facing the sea as an emotionally charged soundtrack pounds in the background. It feels like the trailer for a film. In a voice-over, she proclaims her love of France, the \u201cage-old nation that does not submit.\u201d She promises to stand up against the \u201csufferings of\u201d and \u201cinsults to\u201d the country. The video ends with her behind the wheel of a boat, a clear metaphor for one of her main campaign slogans, to steer the country toward what will \u201cput France in order.\u201d\n\nThe unsubtle subtext is that Paris needs the kind of strong leadership that has been missing under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy before him. The French have always sought a \u201cstrongman\u201d in their presidents, a monarchical instinct that turns them toward authority, especially in times of crisis.\n\n\u201cThis is the country that produced Napoleon, the country that produced Charles de Gaulle,\u201d says Perrineau.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nBut he sees protest as the stronger current pushing Le Pen toward the doors of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e. He references French intellectual Pierre Rosanvallon, who said it\u2019s no longer a time of elections in Western society. It is the time of \u201cdis-elections.\u201d\n\nIn the end, many French voters, says Perrineau, \u201cjust want to vote in the bogeyman.\u201d",

He threatened to end the North American Free Trade Agreement to put pressure on Mexico to do more to stop migrants from Central America from reaching the U.S.\n\nThe tweets culminated with Trump signing a presidential proclamation Wednesday directing his administration to work with border governors to deploy National Guard troops to help guard the Southwest border.\n\nMexico's President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto (Photo: Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nIn the proclamation, Trump characterized the arrival of migrants from Central America as a border-security threat on par with opioids and other illicit drugs \"flowing across our Southern border\" and transnational gangs including MS-13.\n\n\"The situation at the border has now reached a point of crisis,\" Trump wrote in a presidential memorandum. \"The lawlessness that continues at our Southern border is fundamentally incompatible with the safety, security, and sovereignty of the American people.\"\n\nMexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto this week urged Trump to stop with the \"threatening or disrespectful attitudes\" and constructively discuss the issues with Mexico.\n\n\"If your recent statements are the result of frustration due to domestic policy issues, to your laws or to your Congress, it is to them that you should turn to, not to Mexicans,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto said to Trump in a video statement. \"We\u2019re not going to permit that negative rhetoric to define our actions. We\u2019re only going to work in the best interest of the Mexicans.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican Senate also adopted a resolution urging its government to stop working with the United States on illegal immigration and drug trafficking, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.\n\nThis is not the first time a president has deployed National Guard troops to the Southwest border. In 2006, former President George W. Bush deployed about 6,000 National Guard troops in response to requests for help securing the border from the governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.\n\n\u25ba March 30: White House can\u2019t block immigrant teens from abortion, court rules\n\n\u25ba March 29: ICE to hold more pregnant women in immigration detention\n\nIn 2010, former President Barack Obama sent about 1,200 troops to the Southwest border to help support the Border Patrol.\n\nBut conditions at the border were much different then, said Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under former President Bill Clinton. She is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a research group.\n\nBorder Patrol apprehensions are way down, Meissner said, and the Border Patrol has far more agents.\n\n\u25ba March 27: California sues Trump administration over Census citizenship question\n\n\u25ba March 27: Trump ends deportation protections for Liberians\n\nIn 2006, the Border Patrol recorded more than 1 million apprehensions of undocumented border crossers, the majority of them from Mexico\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, Border Patrol apprehensions fell to 310,000, the lowest levels since the 1970s. The flow of undocumented immigrants from Mexico has dropped off sharply while the number of migrants from Central America has increased.\n\nMeanwhile, Border Patrol staffing, meanwhile from 12,349 in fiscal year 2006 to 19,437 in fiscal year 2017, according to Border Patrol data.\n\n\u25ba March 26: Citizenship question be back on 2020 Census for first time in 70 years\n\n\u25ba March 21: Trump, aides ramp up calls for Mueller to end Russia probe\n\nBush ordered National Guard troops to help shore up the Border Patrol while additional agents that Congress had authorized were being hired and trained, Meissner said.\n\nObama was prompted to deploy National Guard troops mostly because of political pressure after Arizona rancher Robert Krentz was killed while working near the border, Meissner said.\n\n\"Trump's decision to deploy troops to the Southwest border is quite disconnected,\" Meissner said. \"It is disconnected from facts on the ground. This image that the country is being invaded is not what\u2019s taking place.\"\n\n\u25ba March 19: Judge dismisses Tennessee's suit seeking to halt refugee resettlement\n\n\u25ba Feb. 7: What is President Trump's policy on 'Dreamers?' It keeps changing\n\nMeissner acknowledged that the U.S. faces new challenges because of the ongoing arrival of Central American migrants fleeing poverty and violence in their countries. She said the U.S. should be working with Mexico to address what she characterized as a regional problem.\n\n\"Mexico is doing law enforcement not simply to please the U.S. but because it has its own important self-interests. We should be supporting them in that and not jeopardizing it,\" she said.\n\nFollow Daniel Gonz\u00e1lez on Twitter: @azdangonzalez\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GINBi0",

        "content": "Joe Biden , who is way ahead in the polls , has called it his \u201c single greatest concern. \u201d What if Donald Trump refuses to leave office freely if Biden , the presumptive Democratic nominee , wins the November election ? Last weekend , the president openly suggested to Fox News that he might not accept the results , declaring : \u201c I \u2019 m not going to just say yes . I \u2019 m not going to say no. \u201d Indeed Trump is already working to invalidate the 2020 tally , accusing Democrats of plotting fraud through mail-in voting that might be needed because of the pandemic , and legal challenges are mounting at an unprecedented rate . Moreover , Trump has spent his entire first term trampling over the institutions of American democracy , obstructing justice and defying Congress and the courts and crying \u201c coup ! \u201d every time he \u2019 s investigated .\nAlternatively , what if Trump doesn \u2019 t seize power illegally but is actually reelected ? Surely that would amount to a virtual mandate , in his mind , to ignore the Constitution and the law of the land altogether . Plenty of fascists past and present\u2014from Benito Mussolini to Vladimir Putin\u2014have made mincemeat of vulnerable democratic systems to install themselves as autocrats . For more than four years , legions of Trump critics have accused him of having fascist tendencies , and American democracy now appears badly wounded , if not broken , and vulnerable to further manipulation , especially since Trump has turned the Republican Party into little more than a cheerleader for his personal aggrandizement .\nFascism , as the Yale University scholar Jason Stanley has written , \u201c is not a new threat , but rather a permanent temptation. \u201d And Trump \u2019 s words and actions indicate that he \u2019 s sorely tempted to emulate autocrats he admires around the world . One never knows for sure when Trump is joking\u2014he insists he is whenever he is criticized for saying something especially controversial\u2014but in 2018 Trump spoke glowingly of Xi Jinping \u2019 s brutal consolidation of power in China and his title of \u201c president for life. \u201d \u201c I think it \u2019 s great . Maybe we \u2019 ll have to give that a shot someday , \u201d Trump said .\nSo let \u2019 s suppose the worst : Trump\u2014whose niece , the author Mary Trump , calls him the \u201c world \u2019 s most dangerous man \u201d \u2014really does attempt to embrace his inner fascist in the coming months . The good news is that history tells us he will almost certainly fail in the end , especially since Trump possesses nothing like the fearsome competence or detailed programs of fascists past . Fascism in its various forms has no enduring record of success in the long run ; based on the evidence , it is almost always doomed to destroy itself in an orgy of ultranationalism and megalomania , as Adolf Hitler and Mussolini did . Other fascists or strongmen who stayed in power longer , like Francisco Franco of Spain and Turkey \u2019 s Kemal Ataturk , did so by wisely changing course or because they were misunderstood and weren \u2019 t really fascists at all for much of their careers , some scholars say .\nBy itself , \u201c fascism is difficult to work in practice because it always has grandiose visions inconsistent with reality , upon whose shores it crashes , \u201d Stanley , the author of How Fascism Works , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . It may be an effective means to gaining power , but fascists typically destroy themselves before long , especially when crises erupt . \u201c We are seeing that with COVID-19 in the United States and Brazil , \u201d Stanley said .\nStanley \u2019 s 2018 book is a detailed look at the broad concept of fascism , which he defines as ultranationalism embodied in one leader and movement , and at the kind of politics that fascism typically practices . These strategies are familiar to anyone who has observed Trump \u2019 s rise : inventing a mythic past of greatness , promoting anti-intellectualism , playing up national victimhood and the need for law and order , appealing to the heartland , and fomenting division , especially by attacking immigrants and liberal elites . Like Trump , fascists almost always promise to \u201c drain the swamp \u201d by concocting false charges of corruption , as the U.S. president did against Hillary Clinton and is now doing against Biden . Above all , Stanley says , fascist politics is about identifying enemies , appealing to an insecure majority group like America \u2019 s white population , and destroying truth and replacing it with power . As Mussolini said in a 1922 speech , to create a fascist national myth \u201c it is not necessary for it to be a reality . \u201d\nIn his book , Stanley invokes the German word Gleichschaltung\u2014describing the Nazification process by which Hitler slowly destroyed Germany \u2019 s liberal democratic organizing principles\u2014to help explain what is happening in several major democracies today , including the United States , India , and Brazil . \u201c In all three countries , there is movement toward unifying institutions around loyalty to an ethnic identity , as in India , or loyalty to a single leader , as in the United States , where the most powerful political party is increasingly defined by fealty to Donald Trump , \u201d Stanley writes . \u201c This threatens the democratic nature of these institutions as well as their competence to carry out their institutional missions . Our democratic culture is on life support . \u201d\nThat may be true , but fascism has a very poor track record as a replacement . Some historians argue that strongmen of the past who were sometimes identified with fascism , like Franco and Ataturk\u2014whose harsh , swift brand of nationalistic transformation inspired Hitler , according to the historian Stefan Ihrig \u2019 s 2014 book , Ataturk in the Nazi Imagination\u2014succeeded in the end only because they outgrew those tendencies .\nAtaturk also pursued long-term plans for national transformation that brought in best practices from Western nations\u2014he hired the famed U.S. educator John Dewey , for example\u2014and even programmed in the return of democracy . Those leaders , in other words , had larger , detailed programs of the kinds that elude Trump . His instincts may be fascist , but he has shown little or no greater purpose other than manipulating the truth to his political benefit and rousing his poorly educated white base .\n\u201c His stupid , careless talk is not really fascist but conceivably subfascist , \u201d said Stanley Payne , a well-known historian of European fascism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . \u201c Both Hitler and Mussolini spoke more toward theoretically coherent goals . \u201d\nEven Spain \u2019 s Franco , the military strongman who toyed with fascism as Hitler and Mussolini rose to dominance in Europe , abandoned it in the end for a more pluralistic system , some historians contend . \u201c The Franco regime in its full form , from 1945 to 1975 , was not fascist , \u201d said Payne , a specialist in Spanish fascism . \u201c A distinction should be made between the Catholic , corporatist , quasi-monarchist system of \u2018 mature Francoism \u2019 and the semi-fascist phase of 1937-45 . Francoism lasted so long that it was more than one thing , though the non-fascist form predominated . \u201d\nIn an interview , Ihrig , a historian at the University of Haifa , said Trump is plainly deploying fascist tactics of the past , but he added : \u201c The United States is not Weimar Germany .

        "content_original": "Joe Biden, who is way ahead in the polls, has called it his \u201csingle greatest concern.\u201d What if Donald Trump refuses to leave office freely if Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, wins the November election? Last weekend, the president openly suggested to Fox News that he might not accept the results, declaring: \u201cI\u2019m not going to just say yes. I\u2019m not going to say no.\u201d Indeed Trump is already working to invalidate the 2020 tally, accusing Democrats of plotting fraud through mail-in voting that might be needed because of the pandemic, and legal challenges are mounting at an unprecedented rate. Moreover, Trump has spent his entire first term trampling over the institutions of American democracy, obstructing justice and defying Congress and the courts and crying \u201ccoup!\u201d every time he\u2019s investigated.\n\nAlternatively, what if Trump doesn\u2019t seize power illegally but is actually reelected? Surely that would amount to a virtual mandate, in his mind, to ignore the Constitution and the law of the land altogether. Plenty of fascists past and present\u2014from Benito Mussolini to Vladimir Putin\u2014have made mincemeat of vulnerable democratic systems to install themselves as autocrats. For more than four years, legions of Trump critics have accused him of having fascist tendencies, and American democracy now appears badly wounded, if not broken, and vulnerable to further manipulation, especially since Trump has turned the Republican Party into little more than a cheerleader for his personal aggrandizement.\n\nFascism, as the Yale University scholar Jason Stanley has written, \u201cis not a new threat, but rather a permanent temptation.\u201d And Trump\u2019s words and actions indicate that he\u2019s sorely tempted to emulate autocrats he admires around the world. One never knows for sure when Trump is joking\u2014he insists he is whenever he is criticized for saying something especially controversial\u2014but in 2018 Trump spoke glowingly of Xi Jinping\u2019s brutal consolidation of power in China and his title of \u201cpresident for life.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s great. Maybe we\u2019ll have to give that a shot someday,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose the worst: Trump\u2014whose niece, the author Mary Trump, calls him the \u201cworld\u2019s most dangerous man\u201d\u2014really does attempt to embrace his inner fascist in the coming months. The good news is that history tells us he will almost certainly fail in the end, especially since Trump possesses nothing like the fearsome competence or detailed programs of fascists past. Fascism in its various forms has no enduring record of success in the long run; based on the evidence, it is almost always doomed to destroy itself in an orgy of ultranationalism and megalomania, as Adolf Hitler and Mussolini did. Other fascists or strongmen who stayed in power longer, like Francisco Franco of Spain and Turkey\u2019s Kemal Ataturk, did so by wisely changing course or because they were misunderstood and weren\u2019t really fascists at all for much of their careers, some scholars say.\n\nBy itself, \u201cfascism is difficult to work in practice because it always has grandiose visions inconsistent with reality, upon whose shores it crashes,\u201d Stanley, the author of How Fascism Works, told Foreign Policy. It may be an effective means to gaining power, but fascists typically destroy themselves before long, especially when crises erupt. \u201cWe are seeing that with COVID-19 in the United States and Brazil,\u201d Stanley said.\n\nStanley\u2019s 2018 book is a detailed look at the broad concept of fascism, which he defines as ultranationalism embodied in one leader and movement, and at the kind of politics that fascism typically practices. These strategies are familiar to anyone who has observed Trump\u2019s rise: inventing a mythic past of greatness, promoting anti-intellectualism, playing up national victimhood and the need for law and order, appealing to the heartland, and fomenting division, especially by attacking immigrants and liberal elites. Like Trump, fascists almost always promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d by concocting false charges of corruption, as the U.S. president did against Hillary Clinton and is now doing against Biden. Above all, Stanley says, fascist politics is about identifying enemies, appealing to an insecure majority group like America\u2019s white population, and destroying truth and replacing it with power. As Mussolini said in a 1922 speech, to create a fascist national myth \u201cit is not necessary for it to be a reality.\u201d\n\nSuch words are like song to Donald Trump.\n\nIn his book, Stanley invokes the German word Gleichschaltung\u2014describing the Nazification process by which Hitler slowly destroyed Germany\u2019s liberal democratic organizing principles\u2014to help explain what is happening in several major democracies today, including the United States, India, and Brazil. \u201cIn all three countries, there is movement toward unifying institutions around loyalty to an ethnic identity, as in India, or loyalty to a single leader, as in the United States, where the most powerful political party is increasingly defined by fealty to Donald Trump,\u201d Stanley writes. \u201cThis threatens the democratic nature of these institutions as well as their competence to carry out their institutional missions. Our democratic culture is on life support.\u201d\n\nThat may be true, but fascism has a very poor track record as a replacement. Some historians argue that strongmen of the past who were sometimes identified with fascism, like Franco and Ataturk\u2014whose harsh, swift brand of nationalistic transformation inspired Hitler, according to the historian Stefan Ihrig\u2019s 2014 book, Ataturk in the Nazi Imagination\u2014succeeded in the end only because they outgrew those tendencies.\n\nAtaturk also pursued long-term plans for national transformation that brought in best practices from Western nations\u2014he hired the famed U.S. educator John Dewey, for example\u2014and even programmed in the return of democracy. Those leaders, in other words, had larger, detailed programs of the kinds that elude Trump. His instincts may be fascist, but he has shown little or no greater purpose other than manipulating the truth to his political benefit and rousing his poorly educated white base.\n\n\u201cHis stupid, careless talk is not really fascist but conceivably subfascist,\u201d said Stanley Payne, a well-known historian of European fascism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cBoth Hitler and Mussolini spoke more toward theoretically coherent goals.\u201d\n\nEven Spain\u2019s Franco, the military strongman who toyed with fascism as Hitler and Mussolini rose to dominance in Europe, abandoned it in the end for a more pluralistic system, some historians contend. \u201cThe Franco regime in its full form, from 1945 to 1975, was not fascist,\u201d said Payne, a specialist in Spanish fascism. \u201cA distinction should be made between the Catholic, corporatist, quasi-monarchist system of \u2018mature Francoism\u2019 and the semi-fascist phase of 1937-45. Francoism lasted so long that it was more than one thing, though the non-fascist form predominated.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Ihrig, a historian at the University of Haifa, said Trump is plainly deploying fascist tactics of the past, but he added: \u201cThe United States is not Weimar Germany. True, we always need to be worried. He is using the classic methods: destroying checks and balances, influencing the legal system to one side, polarizing society and playing with the notion of truth\u2014making it inoperable. These things are really worrisome, but rather than being a fascist himself, I think Trump is more like one of these authoritarian kinds of conservative figures, like in late Weimar Germany, who allied with the Nazis to change the system.\u201d\n\nWhatever Trump\u2019s true nature or aims, such alliances are necessary for fascists to succeed. Like Putin, who today is plainly deploying a form of fascism by controlling corporate Russia, Hitler and Mussolini gained power by manipulating conservative and corporate elites who believed, with tragic consequences, that they could control the emerging dictators. The backing of such elites is crucial for fascists to last more than a few years in power because the \u201ccorporate oligarchy craves a certain kind of stability,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cThis, together with the support of social conservatives who are made to fear nonexistent threats, can and does leave fascism in power in the face of conflicts with reality.\u201d\n\nSuch a support base does not exist to nearly the same degree for Trump. While he has tried hard, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, to enlist and win over corporate America, he has created just as many enemies among the U.S. corporate elite. And from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, America\u2019s business leaders are far more independent than in, say, a country like Russia.\n\nBeyond that, American democracy is 244 years old and not nearly as vulnerable as the young and fragile democratic systems that existed in Weimar and the Italian republic of the early 20th century. America\u2019s constitutional checks and balances, though seemingly strained to the breaking point\u2014as we saw during Trump\u2019s impeachment and acquittal\u2014are far more in evidence than in the case of other fascist takeovers. Even the majority conservative Supreme Court has curtailed some of Trump\u2019s ambitions, ruling most recently that he is not above the law in requiring him to release his financial records to prosecutors. And the U.S. military establishment, which in previous fascist history bent much more willingly to the designs of autocrats in power, has made a stand for constitutional restraints as well. Following the killing of George Floyd in May, Trump\u2019s own defense secretary and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman very publicly distanced themselves from him as he sought to enlist them in his campaign for \u201claw and order\u201d in the face of civil unrest.\n\nStill, Ihrig cautions against complacency. Even though it is nearly two and a half centuries old, American democracy has not yet been fully tested against freshly malign forces like cyberattacks, the historian argues in a forthcoming book. This is especially true since the end of the Cold War, which he compares with the unstable interwar period of the 20th century that led to fascism. \u201cWith the end of the Cold War, certain restraints to the left and right of the spectrum as well as a more general consensus on politics and society disappeared,\u201d Ihrig said. \u201cIf you take away times of war (World War I, World War II, and the Cold War) as well as those in which major parts of society were excluded or underrepresented (women, minorities, also workers in some systems, etc.), then democracy did not have too much time to play out its battles with heavily opposing forces, to test itself, and to come up with a range of successful strategies of coping with fundamental opposition.\u201d\n\nPayne said fascists can and do last in power if they don\u2019t go overboard; the problem for them is they usually do. \u201cHistorical fascism worked very well so long as its leaders stayed out of big wars,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom 1922 to 1940, Mussolini could hardly be described as other than successful.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump isn \u2019 t just keeping a campaign promise to roll back climate change regulations . He appears to be moving ahead to do away with the science behind the effort .\nThe White House has drafted a preliminary budget blueprint that would hack hundreds of millions of research dollars out of the EPA and other agencies tracking the effects of global warming in what would be a stark contrast to the policies under President Obama .\nEnvironmental activists say rolling back rules designed to protect health and ecology is bad enough . But gutting the fact-finding and academic analysis behind the rules poses far-reaching consequences .\n`` If the Trump administration pulls the plug on this , the world goes dark , '' said David Doniger , director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council .\nAmong the proposed cuts the White House could unveil Thursday as part of its official budget :\nEPA science funding , including half the money for studies of the agency \u2019 s Air , Climate , and Energy Research Program . Bill Becker , executive director of the Association of Clean Air Agencies , which includes the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality as a member , was unable to release the proposal from the Trump administration but confirmed the figures .\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research funding to support climate research and the satellite programs that provide the basis for the Obama-era policies aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels . The cut could be as much as 17 % , according to The Washington Post .\nNASA programs coordinating the launch of satellites that monitor changes in sea level , carbon levels and air temperatures that help provide the justification for climate change rules .\nSuch a move would be applauded by key GOP lawmakers who challenge the science behind climate change and the resulting environmental regulations they say have stunted economic growth .\nSen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Lamar Smith , Texas Republicans who both chair congressional panels that oversee the space program , have each called for NASA to transfer earth science to other agencies so it can focus on deep space exploration .\nSome of those reported cuts could change based on review and comment from individual agencies . But environmental activists are not optimistic the proposal coming out next week will change from earlier drafts that make good on the president \u2019 s campaign promises to roll back \u201c job-killing \u201d environmental regulations .\nTrump vowed in October to \u201c cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton , including all global warming payments to the United Nations . \u201d\nThe president said cutting such funding would save $ 100 billion over eight years , money that could be used \u201c to help rebuild the vital infrastructure , including water systems , in America \u2019 s inner cities , \u201d he said during last year \u2019 s presidential campaign . More recently , Trump is trying to find ways of supporting a $ 54 billion increase in Defense spending without raising taxes .\nEnvironmental activists and many Democrats say Trump \u2019 s proposed cuts not only would ignore what President Obama called the greatest threat to the planet , but also hamper global response because of the leading role the U.S. plays as a research engine for the international science community .\nAnnual federal funding for climate change research , technology , international assistance and adaptation has increased from $ 2.4 billion in 1993 to $ 11.6 billion in 2014 spread among 13 federal agencies , according to the Government Accountability Office . An additional $ 26.1 billion for climate change programs and activities was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 .\nThat money is spent in a variety of ways : satellites that track Earth \u2019 s vital signs , government-funded research to measure natural phenomenon such as deforestation , ice melt and habitat migrations , ocean buoys that monitor water temperatures , and agencies that track the health effects of global shifts .\n\u201c Earth science is not unique ( to the U.S. ) . There \u2019 s a lot of very good science around the world , \u201d said Doniger of the NRDC . \u201c But the U.S. has a very heavy commitment in terms of the expertise , who the scientists are and , more importantly , where does the data come from ... It 's really foolish to blind yourself to the information and the information collection effort .

(Photo: Keith Srakocic, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump isn\u2019t just keeping a campaign promise to roll back climate change regulations. He appears to be moving ahead to do away with the science behind the effort.\n\nThe White House has drafted a preliminary budget blueprint that would hack hundreds of millions of research dollars out of the EPA and other agencies tracking the effects of global warming in what would be a stark contrast to the policies under President Obama.\n\nEnvironmental activists say rolling back rules designed to protect health and ecology is bad enough. But gutting the fact-finding and academic analysis behind the rules poses far-reaching consequences.\n\n\"If the Trump administration pulls the plug on this, the world goes dark,\" said David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nAmong the proposed cuts the White House could unveil Thursday as part of its official budget:\n\nEPA science funding, including half the money for studies of the agency\u2019s Air, Climate, and Energy Research Program. Bill Becker, executive director of the Association of Clean Air Agencies, which includes the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality as a member, was unable to release the proposal from the Trump administration but confirmed the figures.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research funding to support climate research and the satellite programs that provide the basis for the Obama-era policies aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels. The cut could be as much as 17%, according to The Washington Post.\n\nNASA programs coordinating the launch of satellites that monitor changes in sea level, carbon levels and air temperatures that help provide the justification for climate change rules.\n\nSuch a move would be applauded by key GOP lawmakers who challenge the science behind climate change and the resulting environmental regulations they say have stunted economic growth.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Lamar Smith, Texas Republicans who both chair congressional panels that oversee the space program, have each called for NASA to transfer earth science to other agencies so it can focus on deep space exploration.\n\nSome of those reported cuts could change based on review and comment from individual agencies. But environmental activists are not optimistic the proposal coming out next week will change from earlier drafts that make good on the president\u2019s campaign promises to roll back \u201cjob-killing\u201d environmental regulations.\n\nTrump vowed in October to \u201ccancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations.\u201d\n\nThe president said cutting such funding would save $100 billion over eight years, money that could be used \u201cto help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America\u2019s inner cities,\u201d he said during last year\u2019s presidential campaign. More recently, Trump is trying to find ways of supporting a $54 billion increase in Defense spending without raising taxes.\n\nRead more:\n\nEnvironmental activists and many Democrats say Trump\u2019s proposed cuts not only would ignore what President Obama called the greatest threat to the planet, but also hamper global response because of the leading role the U.S. plays as a research engine for the international science community.\n\nAnnual federal funding for climate change research, technology, international assistance and adaptation has increased from $2.4 billion in 1993 to $11.6 billion in 2014 spread among 13 federal agencies, according to the Government Accountability Office. An additional $26.1 billion for climate change programs and activities was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009.\n\nThat money is spent in a variety of ways: satellites that track Earth\u2019s vital signs, government-funded research to measure natural phenomenon such as deforestation, ice melt and habitat migrations, ocean buoys that monitor water temperatures, and agencies that track the health effects of global shifts.\n\n\u201cEarth science is not unique (to the U.S.). There\u2019s a lot of very good science around the world,\u201d said Doniger of the NRDC. \u201cBut the U.S. has a very heavy commitment in terms of the expertise, who the scientists are and, more importantly, where does the data come from ... It's really foolish to blind yourself to the information and the information collection effort.\"\n\nU.S. efforts to track climate change have grown steadily over the past 25 years as the scope of the potential threat has become clearer particularly to America\u2019s coastal communities.\n\nCoasts are sensitive to sea level rise, changes in the frequency and intensity of storms, increases in precipitation, and warmer ocean temperatures, according to the EPA. In addition, the agency concludes rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are causing the oceans to absorb more of the gas and become more acidic, which \u201ccan have significant impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrump has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by China. EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a CNBC interview Thursday said he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming.\n\nMembers of the scientific community, environmental advocates and supporters demonstrate in favor of climate change research in Boston last month. (Photo: Steven Senne, AP)\n\nThose views by the two people who may have the most to say about the government\u2019s role in addressing climate change run counter to the conclusions by an overwhelming portion of the scientific community, including the EPA itself.\n\n\u201cCarbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s website. And \"human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, release large amounts of CO2, causing concentrations in the atmosphere to rise.\u201d\n\nGovernment-funded research has helped pinpoint particularly vulnerable parts of the country, notably Florida, whose 1,350 miles of coastline are constantly battered by rising sea levels and fierce storms.\n\nClimate change is of special concern to Florida Sen.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nThey say it also shows that EU efforts to develop a relationship with the White House, including high-profile visits by the French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have largely failed.\n\nThat leaves the EU seeking other alliances, including closer ties with Japan and help from Moscow and Beijing to keep money connected to the nuclear deal flowing to Tehran.\n\n\u201cWe used to roll our eyes at Trump\u2019s policies but now we are seeing the craziness becoming strategic,\u201d another senior EU diplomat who was at the Hill meeting said. \u201cWe now have to seek out all kinds of partners to further our goals.\u201d",

But even though costs aren \u2019 t rising as steeply as they were , they are still rising , and the failure of aid to keep pace with tuition increases means that the net cost students pay for college continues to go up .\nThat \u2019 s one conclusion from the 30th annual `` Trends in College Pricing '' and `` Trends in College Aid '' reports the College Board released Wednesday . Taken together , the comprehensive reports provide not just a snapshot at how both tuition and student aid are shifting in the most recent year \u2013 in which they have been under scrutiny by policymakers determined to make college more affordable \u2013 but also how they \u2019 ve changed over the past three decades .\n\u201c The rapid increases in published college prices have slowed , \u201d says College Board President David Coleman . \u201c However , students and their families are paying more because grant aid hasn \u2019 t kept up. \u201d Still , despite the rising costs , Mr. Coleman emphasizes that a college education \u2013 as evidenced in another recent College Board report , `` Education Pays '' \u2013 is worth it . \u201c I do not want to diminish the real concern around student debt and the price of college , \u201d Coleman says . \u201c But a college education is one of the best investments students and their families can make in terms of health , income , and upward mobility . \u201d\nAmong the key findings from this year 's \u201c Trends \u201d reports are the following :\n\u2022 Published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges increased 2.9 percent from 2012-13 to 2013-14 \u2013 the smallest one-year increase since 1975-76 . After adjusting for inflation , the increase is 0.9 percent , the lowest inflation-adjusted increase since 2000-01 .\n\u2022 Between 2010-11 and 2012-13 , federal grant aid declined \u2013 a major reason that net prices rose for families . Because of earlier increases in aid , the average net price for full-time students attending in-state , public four-year colleges actually fell by $ 650 ( in 2013 dollars ) between 2008-09 and 2009-10 , but between 2009-10 and 2013-14 it increased from $ 1,940 to $ 3,120 .\n\u2022 Over the decade from 2002-03 to 2012-13 , the total number of federal undergraduate and graduate student loan borrowers increased by 69 percent , and the average annual amount borrowed increased by 6 percent , from $ 7,900 ( in 2012 dollars ) in 2002-03 to $ 8,350 . In 2012-13 , the average undergraduate federal loan was $ 6,760 , and the average graduate student loan was $ 17,230 .\n\u2022 Total Pell Grant expenditures peaked at $ 37.5 billion in 2010-11 ( in 2012 dollars ) and declined to $ 32.3 billion by 2012-13 . Both the average grant and the number of recipients were lower in 2012-13 than in 2010-11 .\nPart of the affordability problem is that family income has fallen even as prices for college have risen , says Sandy Baum , co-author of the Trends reports . After adjusted for inflation , real income at all levels of the income distribution were lower in 2012 than they were in 2002 , and at the bottom quintile , family income declined by 13 percent in that decade .\nMs. Baum said the College Board focused the hardest on the \u201c net price \u201d students pay , since most students have access to some form of aid or tax credits , but says that \u201c the news in terms of the college price increase is that it does seem that the spiral is moderating\u2026 . Price increases are moderating , and financial aid is still there , but it \u2019 s not increasing at the rate it would have to to cushion students from the rate increases . \u201d\nThe report also highlights the vast differences between states , both in how much they charge for tuition \u2013 and how much the state subsidizes that tuition \u2013 and in how they grant their aid .\nSouth Carolina and Georgia , for instance , are the most generous with their grant aid per full-time student . But in Georgia , none of that aid is needs-based , and in South Carolina , only 16 percent of the state grand aid was needs-based .\nAnd in 2013-14 , published tuition and fees for in-state students at flagship universities range from $ 4,404 a year at the University of Wyoming to $ 17,926 at Penn State-University Park .\n\u201c There are dramatic differences depending on where you live , \u201d says Baum .\nIn 2012-13 , 49 percent of all student aid was in the form of grants \u2013 the highest percentage over the past decade . But many students are still borrowing . Some 60 percent of students who earned bachelor \u2019 s degrees in 2011-12 from the public and private nonprofit institutions at which they began their studies graduated with debt , borrowing an average of $ 26,500 . Some 1.6 million students are in income-based repayment plans \u2013 about 11 percent of borrowers .\nThe College Board has published the trends on both college pricing and student aid and borrowing annually for 30 years now , but this year , the reports come at a time of increased attention to the college affordability problem .\nIn August , President Obama drew attention to the problem and called for a new college ranking system that would emphasize things like graduation rates and sticker price as a means to help make colleges more affordable .\n`` We \u2019 re going to start rating colleges not just by which college is the most selective , not just by which college is the most expensive , not just by which college has the nicest facilities \u2013 you can get all of that on the existing rating systems . What we want to do is rate them on who 's offering the best value so students and taxpayers get a bigger bang for their buck , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a speech last month at the University of Buffalo , in New York .\nNumerous people , including a number of colleges , have pushed back against that proposal \u2013 and it remains unlikely that this Congress would agree to tie federal student aid to such a system \u2013 but most people agree that spiraling college costs and student debt are a problem .\nThe latest data from the Trends reports , says Baum , show that \u201c there aren \u2019 t any magic bullets here. \u201d What \u2019 s needed , she and Coleman say , is to be thinking more about appropriately targeting student aid for those who need it most , having adequate public funding for higher education , and providing better guidance for students trying to navigate the complex decisions involved . Often the least information is available to the students who need it most , they say , and the College Board is working to get better information to low-income students .\nBut they also emphasize the value , despite the rising costs , that a college education still gives students \u2013 and worry that the current discussion about the danger of taking on debt will discourage some students from getting that education , particularly those with the least access to good information , or who don \u2019 t have family members who have gone to college .\n\u201c It is imperative that we provide the best information possible to students and their families about the value of a college education and what debt really means , \u201d says Coleman , noting that the average debt for a bachelor \u2019 s degree recipient is $ 26,500 \u2013 which could be repaid in 10 years by payments of less than $ 300 per month . But studies show that an average bachelor \u2019 s degree recipient can expect to earn an extra $ 550,000 to $ 600,000 in income in his or her lifetime compared with those who do not , he says . \u201c I don \u2019 t diminish the real concerns about the price of college , but it is a moral and social imperative that we \u2019 re clear about the truth . \u201d",

        "content": "\u201c This is a values conversation and decision at a root level . How much do you want everybody to be treated the same ? \u201d says Linda Blumberg , a health policy expert at the Urban Institute . \u201c We have a structure that with its gaps and shortcomings can be built upon and improved . \u201d\nFor supporters , a key choice is whether to seek a \u201c single payer \u201d system that would centralize administration in the government , or to add a \u201c public option \u201d alongside other insurance plans . Some candidates say the first will be most efficient . Others support the second as a less-wrenching change , and as a system that can better leverage competition among providers .\nDemocratic presidential candidates are supporting various plans , often under the name \u201c Medicare for All. \u201d And they \u2019 re drawing energy from public opinion . Polls have found growing public concern about health care , as costs keep rising and the United States remains alone among advanced economies in lacking universal insurance .\nAmerican politicians have proposed universal coverage as far back as 1912 , when Theodore Roosevelt supported it during his unsuccessful third-party campaign to regain the presidency . Today , that goal is rising again .\nWhen the House Rules Committee recently took up a controversial topic \u2013 shifting U.S. health care onto the shoulders of government as a \u201c single payer \u201d \u2013 the voice of one witness seemed loudest precisely because he had none . Due to illness , activist Ady Barkan was unable to speak to the committee . Instead his typed responses , delivered to the room by a monotone synthetic voice , told of his battles with insurance companies as he seeks both medical care and time with his wife and young son .\n\u201c If I couldn \u2019 t use GoFundMe , I would probably start by asking my parents to start spending down their retirement savings , then we would go hat in hand to friends . Nobody dealing with a serious illness should have to do either of these things , \u201d he said . \u201c We should instead have a rational , fair , comprehensive social safety net that actually catches us when we fall . \u201d\nAt the April 30 hearing , Mr. Barkan was among several witnesses and lawmakers who urged the case for a single-payer system .\nIt would be a radical break from the status quo . Supporters say that \u2019 s exactly the point , after what they see as years of inaction and half measures , and with more than 27 million Americans lacking health insurance . Critics say there are reasons this idea hasn \u2019 t flown in the United States before and why it shouldn \u2019 t fly now .\nBut look beneath the surface of the \u201c Medicare for All \u201d debate , and the real story may be about the revival of a basic ideal : the goal of universal health insurance \u2013 whether it \u2019 s called a human right , as Mr. Barkan and some Democratic presidential candidates do , or is just something that a rich nation can afford for its citizens .\nThe goal is neither new nor , historically , exclusive to the Democratic Party . In a 2015 Harris poll , 84 % of Americans agreed it \u2019 s \u201c a moral issue \u201d to have \u201c a system that ensures that sick people get the care they need. \u201d That included 75 % of Republicans .\nYet for many , that view doesn \u2019 t automatically mean the government should be the sole buyer of insurance . Even among Democratic voters , there are concerns about how to both control costs and avoid rationing of care in such a system .\n\u201c All the candidates are interested in improving affordability and access [ to health care ] relative to what we have today , \u201d says Linda Blumberg , an expert on health policy at the Urban Institute in Washington . But \u201c we \u2019 re a pretty incremental country . We don \u2019 t move too fast . We don \u2019 t like disruption , and we generally don \u2019 t like to be told what to do . \u201d\nDriving the discussion : Health care has risen in importance for voters in recent years , judging by exit polls of voters after they cast ballots . A key reason is financial , with the cost of health care continuing to rise as a share of household budgets .\nFor many , it \u2019 s also that , even as \u201c Obamacare \u201d has grown more accepted as a vehicle for expanding access to care , Republicans have sought to repeal it without having a clear replacement plan .\n\u201c The attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act really scared the American people , \u201d says Topher Spiro , a health-policy specialist at the liberal Center for American Progress in Washington . \u201c When you try to take something away , it tends to be highly motivating . \u201d\nSupport for a single-payer system seems to have risen over the past year or so . Yet , even as the issue galvanizes the political left , Democratic candidates and lawmakers are far from united over what Medicare for All means .\nTo some people , this means making a government health plan the only one available \u2013 a true single-payer system with the advantages of universal coverage and economies of scale . Supporters say costs for care would fall as government uses its leverage to set lower prices with doctors and hospitals .\nCritics worry that costs would instead rise as the government seeks to provide more benefits to more people .\nThis pros-and-cons debate \u2013 outlined both in a report that Ms. Blumberg co-authored and in a Congressional Budget Office analysis \u2013 has erupted along partisan lines , as Republicans question the ability of government to vastly expand its role over a sector that currently represents nearly one-fifth of U.S. economic activity .\n\u201c I would say that anybody believes that a government-run health care system provides better health care at lower prices , I got some land that \u2019 s underwater I need to sell you for high-rise condos , \u201d Rep. Ralph Norman , a Republican from South Carolina , said on May 22 at a second House hearing on the issue .\nBut also at that hearing , Democratic Rep.

        "content_original": "\u201cThis is a values conversation and decision at a root level. How much do you want everybody to be treated the same?\u201d says Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute. \u201cWe have a structure that with its gaps and shortcomings can be built upon and improved.\u201d\n\nFor supporters, a key choice is whether to seek a \u201csingle payer\u201d system that would centralize administration in the government, or to add a \u201cpublic option\u201d alongside other insurance plans. Some candidates say the first will be most efficient. Others support the second as a less-wrenching change, and as a system that can better leverage competition among providers.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates are supporting various plans, often under the name \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d And they\u2019re drawing energy from public opinion. Polls have found growing public concern about health care, as costs keep rising and the United States remains alone among advanced economies in lacking universal insurance.\n\nAmerican politicians have proposed universal coverage as far back as 1912, when Theodore Roosevelt supported it during his unsuccessful third-party campaign to regain the presidency. Today, that goal is rising again.\n\nWhen the House Rules Committee recently took up a controversial topic \u2013 shifting U.S. health care onto the shoulders of government as a \u201csingle payer\u201d \u2013 the voice of one witness seemed loudest precisely because he had none. Due to illness, activist Ady Barkan was unable to speak to the committee. Instead his typed responses, delivered to the room by a monotone synthetic voice, told of his battles with insurance companies as he seeks both medical care and time with his wife and young son.\n\n\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t use GoFundMe, I would probably start by asking my parents to start spending down their retirement savings, then we would go hat in hand to friends. Nobody dealing with a serious illness should have to do either of these things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should instead have a rational, fair, comprehensive social safety net that actually catches us when we fall.\u201d\n\nAt the April 30 hearing, Mr. Barkan was among several witnesses and lawmakers who urged the case for a single-payer system.\n\nIt would be a radical break from the status quo. Supporters say that\u2019s exactly the point, after what they see as years of inaction and half measures, and with more than 27 million Americans lacking health insurance. Critics say there are reasons this idea hasn\u2019t flown in the United States before and why it shouldn\u2019t fly now.\n\nBut look beneath the surface of the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d debate, and the real story may be about the revival of a basic ideal: the goal of universal health insurance \u2013 whether it\u2019s called a human right, as Mr. Barkan and some Democratic presidential candidates do, or is just something that a rich nation can afford for its citizens.\n\nThe goal is neither new nor, historically, exclusive to the Democratic Party. In a 2015 Harris poll, 84% of Americans agreed it\u2019s \u201ca moral issue\u201d to have \u201ca system that ensures that sick people get the care they need.\u201d That included 75% of Republicans.\n\nYet for many, that view doesn\u2019t automatically mean the government should be the sole buyer of insurance. Even among Democratic voters, there are concerns about how to both control costs and avoid rationing of care in such a system.\n\n\u201cAll the candidates are interested in improving affordability and access [to health care] relative to what we have today,\u201d says Linda Blumberg, an expert on health policy at the Urban Institute in Washington. But \u201cwe\u2019re a pretty incremental country. We don\u2019t move too fast. We don\u2019t like disruption, and we generally don\u2019t like to be told what to do.\u201d\n\nA key issue for voters\n\nDriving the discussion: Health care has risen in importance for voters in recent years, judging by exit polls of voters after they cast ballots. A key reason is financial, with the cost of health care continuing to rise as a share of household budgets.\n\nFor many, it\u2019s also that, even as \u201cObamacare\u201d has grown more accepted as a vehicle for expanding access to care, Republicans have sought to repeal it without having a clear replacement plan.\n\n\u201cThe attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act really scared the American people,\u201d says Topher Spiro, a health-policy specialist at the liberal Center for American Progress in Washington. \u201cWhen you try to take something away, it tends to be highly motivating.\u201d\n\nSupport for a single-payer system seems to have risen over the past year or so. Yet, even as the issue galvanizes the political left, Democratic candidates and lawmakers are far from united over what Medicare for All means.\n\nTo some people, this means making a government health plan the only one available \u2013 a true single-payer system with the advantages of universal coverage and economies of scale. Supporters say costs for care would fall as government uses its leverage to set lower prices with doctors and hospitals.\n\nCritics worry that costs would instead rise as the government seeks to provide more benefits to more people.\n\nThis pros-and-cons debate \u2013 outlined both in a report that Ms. Blumberg co-authored and in a Congressional Budget Office analysis \u2013 has erupted along partisan lines, as Republicans question the ability of government to vastly expand its role over a sector that currently represents nearly one-fifth of U.S. economic activity.\n\n\u201cI would say that anybody believes that a government-run health care system provides better health care at lower prices, I got some land that\u2019s underwater I need to sell you for high-rise condos,\u201d Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican from South Carolina, said on May 22 at a second House hearing on the issue.\n\nBut also at that hearing, Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state noted that nations with single-payer systems provide universal coverage while spending less on health care than the U.S. does.\n\nLess radical change?\n\nUntil Republicans offer a rival plan of their own, the big battle is really among Democrats themselves. Some presidential contenders argue that the goal of universal coverage can be better attained with less radical change, such as creating a \u201cpublic option.\u201d\n\nIn fact, while the U.S. stands alone among advanced economies in not offering universal coverage, the models in those other nations are varied and far from one-size-fits-all. That idea may resonate with Americans who tend to value choices \u2013 whether of doctors, of insurance plans, or of approaches to care, such as for conditions that may have no known medical cure.\n\nPolls suggest that many Americans don't want their employer-based plans \u2013 or the current version of Medicare \u2013 to disappear.\n\n\u201cOne doesn\u2019t necessarily have to go to a single-payer system,\u201d says Sara Collins, an expert at the Commonwealth Fund in New York, which supports the goal of universal coverage. \u201cOne can build on the current system.

Some experts see the current high costs in the U.S. as an inherently vexing challenge, no matter what path the nation takes.\n\nFor instance, if policymakers tried to extend current Medicare pricing to all Americans, that would be asking hospitals to take an instant pay cut, since Medicare currently doesn\u2019t pay them as much as private insurers do.\n\n\u201cI think there would probably be almost immediate tremendous pressure\u201d upward on prices, says Ed Dolan, an economist at the Niskanen Center, a free-market-oriented think tank in Washington.\n\nPointing to the Netherlands, which blends taxpayer funding with competing private insurance providers, he says \u201cit seems a lot easier to move the American system into that model\u201d than to migrate toward a more government-centered system such as Britain\u2019s.\n\nWhatever the details, some advocates say what\u2019s most vital is that Americans shouldn\u2019t have to worry about going without health care, or about facing financially ruinous choices.\n\nAmerican politicians have proposed universal coverage as far back as 1912, when former President Theodore Roosevelt supported it as part of his unsuccessful third-party campaign for the White House.\n\nCongress sought to move toward that goal by creating Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for low-income Americans in the 1960s.

        "content": "President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer Pennsylvania governor : Biden nomination will be 'virtually clinched ' after next Tuesday How coronavirus is changing Sunday 's debate The Memo : Coronavirus scrambles the art of campaigning MORE on Wednesday gave a rare Oval Office address to reassure a worried nation about the spread of the novel coronavirus , which has infected more than 1,000 Americans and killed more than 30 thus far .\nIn the address Trump detailed new travel restrictions and targeted economic relief for small businesses and individuals affected by the virus , while calling on Congress for further action on payroll tax relief and benefits for hourly workers .\nMy fellow Americans , tonight I want to speak with you about our nation 's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world . Today the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic . We have been in frequent contact with our allies and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people .\nThis is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history . I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus . From the beginning of time nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges , including large-scale and very dangerous health threats . This is the way it always was and always will be . It only matters how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism . Our team is the best anywhere in the world .\nAt the very start of the outbreak , we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years . With we declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection . And taking early intense action we 've seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe . The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots . As a result a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe . After consulting with our top government health professionals I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well being of all Americans .\nTo keep new cases from entering our shores , we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days . The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight . These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground . There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo , but various other things as we get approval . Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing . These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom . At the same time , we 're monitoring the situation in China and South Korea , and as their situation improves , we will re-evaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening .\nEarlier this week I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments , extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing . We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make anti-viral therapies available in record time . These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus . Additionally last week I signed into law an $ 8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines , treatments and distribution of medical supplies . Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly . Day by day , we 're moving very quickly .\nThe vast majority of Americans , the risk is very , very low . Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus . The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions . The elderly population must be very , very careful . In particular , we 're strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits .\nIn general older Americans should also avoid non-essential travel in crowded areas . My administration is coordinated directly with communities with largest outbreaks and we have issued guidance on school closures , social distancing and reducing large gatherings .\nSmart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow . Every community faces different risks , and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts , and they are the best .

        "content_original": "President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer Pennsylvania governor: Biden nomination will be 'virtually clinched' after next Tuesday How coronavirus is changing Sunday's debate The Memo: Coronavirus scrambles the art of campaigning MORE on Wednesday gave a rare Oval Office address to reassure a worried nation about the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 1,000 Americans and killed more than 30 thus far.\n\nIn the address Trump detailed new travel restrictions and targeted economic relief for small businesses and individuals affected by the virus, while calling on Congress for further action on payroll tax relief and benefits for hourly workers.\n\nRead the president's full address below:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMy fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world. Today the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic. We have been in frequent contact with our allies and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people.\n\nThis is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus. From the beginning of time nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best anywhere in the world.\n\nAt the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. With we declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection. And taking early intense action we've seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. As a result a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe. After consulting with our top government health professionals I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well being of all Americans.\n\nTo keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom. At the same time, we're monitoring the situation in China and South Korea, and as their situation improves, we will re-evaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.\n\nEarlier this week I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing. We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make anti-viral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus. Additionally last week I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly. Day by day, we're moving very quickly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful. In particular, we're strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits.\n\nIn general older Americans should also avoid non-essential travel in crowded areas. My administration is coordinated directly with communities with largest outbreaks and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing and reducing large gatherings.\n\nSmart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow. Every community faces different risks, and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts, and they are the best. For all Americans it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home. To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus. I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.\n\nBecause of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far.

This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.\n\nThis is not a financial crisis; this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.

That being the case , the Supreme Court 's landmark health care ruling is almost certain to open the door to lawsuits challenging the federal government 's authority .\nThe court ruled the federal government ca n't force states to participate in a major expansion of Medicaid or else risk losing existing Medicaid funds from Washington . That threat amounted to unconstitutional coercion .\n`` In this case , the financial 'inducement ' Congress has chosen is much more than 'relatively mild encouragement ' \u2014 it is a gun to the head , '' Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion .\nCongress and federal agencies frequently put strings on the money they give to states . But the high court 's health ruling did n't draw a clear line between the types of financial conditions that are OK and those that are unfair to states .\n`` The way Roberts wrote the opinion , it 's a deliberate invitation to litigation , '' says Brian Galle , a law professor at Boston College .\nThis could become a very significant ruling if they 're willing to be aggressive about elaborating on this .\nIt 's possible that this ruling will have broad implications , because Congress uses the threat of financial penalties to get states to do all kinds of things , such as meeting clean air requirements and making elementary school children take annual standardized tests .\nIt 's also possible that it wo n't mean much , because Medicaid is such an exceptionally large program . `` This could be a sui generis situation , '' says Tim Conlan , a public policy professor at George Mason University . `` No other federal-state program comes close to the size of Medicaid . ''\nBut Conlan says there appear to be a majority of justices willing to ask larger questions about the limits on congressional spending power than has been the case for decades .\n`` This could become a very significant ruling if they 're willing to be aggressive about elaborating on this , '' he says .\nThe justices probably will get a chance to do so . States are likely to be emboldened to challenge other federal strictures . If courts find financial penalties that are much smaller than Medicaid to be unconstitutionally harmful to states , this could lead to a massive shift in relations between the states and the federal government \u2014 Congress would become much more limited in its ability to impose national standards over a vast amount of domestic policy .\nA spokeswoman for the National Association of Attorneys General says the group 's members are still sorting out what the health care ruling means for other federal-state programs . The offices of individual state attorneys general , including some who challenged the health care law , similarly say they have n't yet thought through all the implications .\nWe 've had very little guidance about the point at which a condition becomes coercive . I 'm not sure we really have any more guidance now .\nState attorneys general and governors often challenge new rules out of Washington . Typically , they do n't win . `` I do n't know that states have won anything since the New Deal , '' says Ray Scheppach , a former executive director of the National Governors Association .\nBut the Medicaid ruling gives them new impetus to try .\n`` States are not going to stand passively by and allow the federal government to pass detrimental legislation , '' says Susan Frederick , federal affairs counsel for the National Conference of State Legislatures . She added : `` What we can take away from the Affordable Care Act litigation is that states are no longer afraid to challenge federal legislation . ''\nConlan agrees . `` If there 's ever been an open invitation for attorneys general to pursue cases , this was it , '' he notes . `` The court did not do what it did in Bush v. Gore , which was to say there will never be another case with these characteristics , which they could have done easily . ''\nCongress has been imposing requirements on states in exchange for money for at least a century , Conlan says . During the 19th century , Congress handed out land grant and college funds without any real provisos . Since then , however , Congress has used its spending authority to force states to change the way they do business in lots of areas , from highway administration to welfare policy .\n`` In a sense , Congress learned its lessons about just providing the funds and leaving it up to states ' good judgment , '' Conlan says .\nBut the Medicare decision upends that dynamic . If governors in states such as Louisiana , Florida and Texas make good on recent announcements that they wo n't participate in the Medicaid expansion , the federal government lacks leverage to do much about it .\n`` It is true that this is the first time that the court has invalidated an expansion based upon restraint on federal power , '' says James Blumstein , a law professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote an amicus brief in the Medicaid case that anticipated Roberts ' ruling .\n`` But they 've always said for years , decades , that this [ limit ] existed , '' Blumstein says . `` If this [ Medicaid rule ] had not crossed the line , the line would n't have existed . ''\nSo where exactly is the line now ? No one is certain .\nIn his health care opinion , Roberts cited a 1987 decision , South Dakota v. Dole , in which the court found that it was n't `` impermissively coercive , '' as the chief justice put it , to require states to raise the minimum drinking age to 21 or lose 5 percent of their federal highway funds .\nThe sum at stake amounted to less than one-half of 1 percent of South Dakota 's budget at the time \u2014 a lot less than the share of federal Medicaid money that makes up every state 's budget , which is about 15 percent , according to the National Association of State Budget Officers .\nBut because there 's such a big gap between the amount of money the court has said is permissible and the amount it has ruled is unconstitutional , no one has a clear sense of how much leverage Congress can wield over the states .\n`` We 've had very little guidance about the point at which a condition becomes coercive , '' says Richard Garnett , associate dean of Notre Dame Law School . `` I 'm not sure we really have any more guidance now . ''\nIt 's possible that the Medicaid ruling will remain an outlier . Medicaid is far and away the largest federal-state program , and it was an unusual move for Congress to put the entirety of existing Medicaid dollars at risk , as opposed to a small percentage of program funding .\nSupreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that justices were open to exploring limits on what Washington could force states to do , based on congressional spending power , but nothing much came of those cases . And the court said as far back as the 1930s that it did n't want to wade into the murky waters of defining what might constitute coercion because that would result in `` endless difficulties . ''\nOn the other hand , nothing in the court 's opinion suggested that it views Medicaid as unique because of its size .\nOther federal rules also put lots of money at risk . The government places numerous strings on education dollars , for instance . Those may not make up a huge percentage of any state 's spending , but federal grant money dominates the budgets of some school districts , which might be encouraged to sue when presented with strictures they do n't like .\nThe Civil Rights Act , meanwhile , threatens to cut off all federal dollars from any entity that discriminates on the basis of race or gender .\nIt 's also unclear whether the court 's decision opens the door for states and localities to challenge existing rules , or only new ones .\n`` The Supreme Court knows that this decision is going to result in some federal rules being ruled unconstitutional by some judges and maybe even upheld by some circuit courts , '' says Galle , the Boston College law professor . `` They know that .

Dole, in which the court found that it wasn't \"impermissively coercive,\" as the chief justice put it, to require states to raise the minimum drinking age to 21 or lose 5 percent of their federal highway funds.\n\nThe sum at stake amounted to less than one-half of 1 percent of South Dakota's budget at the time \u2014 a lot less than the share of federal Medicaid money that makes up every state's budget, which is about 15 percent, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.\n\nBut because there's such a big gap between the amount of money the court has said is permissible and the amount it has ruled is unconstitutional, no one has a clear sense of how much leverage Congress can wield over the states.\n\n\"We've had very little guidance about the point at which a condition becomes coercive,\" says Richard Garnett, associate dean of Notre Dame Law School. \"I'm not sure we really have any more guidance now.\"\n\nRedefining The Lines\n\nIt's possible that the Medicaid ruling will remain an outlier. Medicaid is far and away the largest federal-state program, and it was an unusual move for Congress to put the entirety of existing Medicaid dollars at risk, as opposed to a small percentage of program funding.\n\nSupreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that justices were open to exploring limits on what Washington could force states to do, based on congressional spending power, but nothing much came of those cases. And the court said as far back as the 1930s that it didn't want to wade into the murky waters of defining what might constitute coercion because that would result in \"endless difficulties.\"\n\nOn the other hand, nothing in the court's opinion suggested that it views Medicaid as unique because of its size.\n\nOther federal rules also put lots of money at risk. The government places numerous strings on education dollars, for instance. Those may not make up a huge percentage of any state's spending, but federal grant money dominates the budgets of some school districts, which might be encouraged to sue when presented with strictures they don't like.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act, meanwhile, threatens to cut off all federal dollars from any entity that discriminates on the basis of race or gender.\n\nIt's also unclear whether the court's decision opens the door for states and localities to challenge existing rules, or only new ones.\n\n\"The Supreme Court knows that this decision is going to result in some federal rules being ruled unconstitutional by some judges and maybe even upheld by some circuit courts,\" says Galle, the Boston College law professor. \"They know that.\"",

Officers simply checked one of 10 boxes on a form , which included \u201c Suspicious Bulge/Object \u201d under a suspect 's clothing and so-called \u201c Furtive Movements . \u201d\nThis allowed the NYPD to stop people , about 85 percent of them black and Latino men , by the hundreds of thousands a year .

        "content": "Climate change , by nature , is a global problem . Each ton of carbon dioxide affects the climate , whether emitted in Stockholm or Shanghai . At the heart of the Paris Agreement in 2015 is a bargain among nations to nudge one another toward ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in an effort to stabilize global temperatures . The bargain also called on rich nations to help developing ones adapt . Now comes a test of the \u201c we \u2019 re in this together \u201d spirit . At the COP24 , this year \u2019 s United Nations climate summit , a key task is to firm up plans for developed nations to contribute more than $ 100 billion a year by 2020 to help other countries . \u201c [ The developed world ] has to take historical responsibility for this , \u201d says Nigerian climate official Peter Tarfa , noting the outsize emissions of industrialized nations . But the rationale is also pragmatic . More support translates into lower emissions in places with rising populations and aspirations for middle-class lifestyles . \u201c It \u2019 s not a question of forcing developed countries to pay , \u201d Dr. Tarfa says . It \u2019 s getting them \u201c to see the benefits of such action . \u201d\nIn 2015 , the Paris Agreement on climate change rallied the world \u2019 s nations around a sense of collective resolve , a spirit of \u201c We \u2019 re all in this together . \u201d\nLeaders embraced the idea that this global-scale problem requires ambitious action from every nation to cut greenhouse-gas emissions . They also agreed that wealthier nations should help finance the efforts of poorer ones .\nSome of that money has already started to flow . But a key moment has arrived . Three years later , it \u2019 s the appointed time to firm up plans to hit a $ 100-billion-a-year target for such international transfers by 2020 \u2013 and to expand this \u201c climate finance \u201d further from there .\nThe national and global initiatives are intertwined . Without help , developing nations will be less able to pursue ambitious targets for low-carbon economies . Officials from postcolonial and developing nations in the \u201c global south \u201d say industrialized nations should bring more money to the table \u2013 for everyone \u2019 s sake .\n\u201c If developed economies put off their climate payments any longer , the Paris Agreement temperature goals will slip out of reach , with tragic consequences for people and planet , '' J. Ant\u00f4nio Marcondes , chief negotiator for Brazil , writes in an email to the Monitor . \u201c These finance commitments were not mere ornaments to the Paris Agreement . They were fundamental elements in the balance of the Agreement which must be fully delivered for developed countries to meet their historical responsibilities , and for developing countries to reach an even higher gear . \u201d\nA higher gear may be vital .

        "content_original": "Climate change, by nature, is a global problem. Each ton of carbon dioxide affects the climate, whether emitted in Stockholm or Shanghai. At the heart of the Paris Agreement in 2015 is a bargain among nations to nudge one another toward ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in an effort to stabilize global temperatures. The bargain also called on rich nations to help developing ones adapt. Now comes a test of the \u201cwe\u2019re in this together\u201d spirit. At the COP24, this year\u2019s United Nations climate summit, a key task is to firm up plans for developed nations to contribute more than $100 billion a year by 2020 to help other countries. \u201c[The developed world] has to take historical responsibility for this,\u201d says Nigerian climate official Peter Tarfa, noting the outsize emissions of industrialized nations. But the rationale is also pragmatic. More support translates into lower emissions in places with rising populations and aspirations for middle-class lifestyles. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of forcing developed countries to pay,\u201d Dr. Tarfa says. It\u2019s getting them \u201cto see the benefits of such action.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the Paris Agreement on climate change rallied the world\u2019s nations around a sense of collective resolve, a spirit of \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\nLeaders embraced the idea that this global-scale problem requires ambitious action from every nation to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. They also agreed that wealthier nations should help finance the efforts of poorer ones.\n\nNow the spirit of togetherness is being tested.\n\nSome of that money has already started to flow. But a key moment has arrived. Three years later, it\u2019s the appointed time to firm up plans to hit a $100-billion-a-year target for such international transfers by 2020 \u2013 and to expand this \u201cclimate finance\u201d further from there.\n\nThe national and global initiatives are intertwined. Without help, developing nations will be less able to pursue ambitious targets for low-carbon economies. Officials from postcolonial and developing nations in the \u201cglobal south\u201d say industrialized nations should bring more money to the table \u2013 for everyone\u2019s sake.\n\n\u201cIf developed economies put off their climate payments any longer, the Paris Agreement temperature goals will slip out of reach, with tragic consequences for people and planet,\" J. Ant\u00f4nio Marcondes, chief negotiator for Brazil, writes in an email to the Monitor. \u201cThese finance commitments were not mere ornaments to the Paris Agreement. They were fundamental elements in the balance of the Agreement which must be fully delivered for developed countries to meet their historical responsibilities, and for developing countries to reach an even higher gear.\u201d\n\nA higher gear may be vital. The outlook appears daunting on several fronts.\n\nThis week came news that, despite global efforts to date, the world\u2019s greenhouse emissions continue to rise, driven especially by increases in China and India. Meanwhile, the United States under President Trump has backed away from its Paris climate commitments, and recent protests prompted the French government to cancel a gas tax designed to curb reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nStill, with all the challenges there\u2019s also hope and a tangible sense of determined optimism in Katowice, Poland, at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known for short as COP24. The ethos of \u201cwe\u2019re in this together\u201d hasn\u2019t died out.\n\n\u201cThe expected commitments that we\u2019re hearing from developed countries are all positive,\u201d says Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, director of sustainable finance at the World Resources Institute think tank, speaking by phone from Poland. \u201cWe don't know yet what the numbers are going to be precisely, but we do know that there\u2019s a collective sense that this has to be done.\u201d\n\nHe notes that, ahead of the summit for climate officials, Germany said it will contribute $1.7 billion to the Green Climate Fund for developing nations, nearly twice the support it gave the last time industrialized nations replenished that fund.

The next day, a house panel passed a 9/11 bill\n\n\u201cThe supreme leader\u2019s government then insulted Japan by attacking a Japanese-owned oil tanker just outside Iranian waters, threatening the lives of the entire crew, creating a maritime emergency,\u201d Pompeo added.\n\nAt the United Nations, the Security Council held closed consultations on the tanker incidents late Thursday at the request of the United States but took no action.\n\nTensions have escalated in the Mideast as Iran appears poised to break the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, an accord that President Donald Trump repudiated last year. In the deal, Tehran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of crippling sanctions. Now, Iran is threatening to resume enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels if European nations don\u2019t offer it new terms to the deal by July 7.\n\nAlready, Iran says it quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions have cut off opportunities for Iran to trade its excess uranium and heavy water abroad, putting Tehran on course to violate terms of the nuclear deal regardless.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia said early Friday its military intercepted five drones launched by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels targeting the kingdom, including the Abha regional airport. The kingdom said a similar attack Wednesday on the Abha airport wounded 26 people.\n\nAssociated Press writers Edith M.

        "content_original": "At first glance, it might appear that Chicago is doing many things right in its fight against gun violence.\n\nStrict gun laws prohibit the purchase of guns within city limits, ban the possession of assault weapons, and call for steep fines if stolen or lost guns are not reported to police.

While partisanship is a fact of American life , Republicans and Democrats have similar views on some aspects of the coronavirus outbreak , though areas of significant disagreement remain .\nHere are five facts about partisan responses to the coronavirus outbreak .\nHow we did this This post on partisanship and COVID-19 is drawn from a new survey exploring how Americans are continuing to respond to the coronavirus outbreak and explores how these views compare by party affiliation . For this analysis , we surveyed 11,537 U.S. adults March 19-24 2020 . Everyone who took part is a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s American Trends Panel ( ATP ) , an online survey panel that is recruited through national , random sampling of residential addresses .

Read more about the ATP \u2019 s methodology . Here are the questions used for the report , along with responses , and its methodology .\n1 Majorities in both parties say that a range of restrictions have been necessary to confront the outbreak . For instance , 94 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and 85 % of Republicans and Republican leaners say it has been necessary to close K-12 schools , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 survey conducted March 19-24 . Majorities of both groups also see steps such as restricting international travel to the U.S. and canceling major sports and entertainment events as necessary to address the coronavirus outbreak . While there is broad bipartisan support for most measures , the shares of Democrats who say these steps are necessary tend to be even larger than the shares of Republicans who say the same .\nThere \u2019 s also general partisan agreement that top public officials have done a good job responding to the coronavirus outbreak . Majorities of Republicans ( 84 % ) and Democrats ( 74 % ) say public health officials , such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , are doing an excellent or good job . Majorities of both groups also say their state and local elected officials are doing an excellent or good job .\n2 There is a wide partisan gap on views of President Donald Trump \u2019 s response to the outbreak . Although both Republicans and Democrats rate the responses of public health officials and state and local elected officials positively in the survey conducted last week , partisans are deeply divided on views of Trump \u2019 s response . A broad majority of Republicans and Republican leaners ( 83 % ) rate Trump \u2019 s response to the outbreak as either excellent or good ; just 18 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same .\nTrump \u2019 s overall job approval rating increased 5 percentage points between January and late March , though more continue to say they disapprove ( 52 % ) than approve ( 45 % ) of how he \u2019 s handling his job . While the uptick in Trump \u2019 s approval rating has come across the board , the partisan gap in his job ratings remains enormous : Republicans are 73 points more likely than Democrats to say they approve of how Trump is handling his job as president ( 85 % vs. 12 % ) .\n3 Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see the coronavirus in the most serious terms . As of last week , nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 78 % ) say the outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole ; a much smaller share of Republicans and GOP leaners ( 52 % ) say the same . Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say the coronavirus outbreak presents a major threat to the U.S. economy , their personal finances and their own health .\nWhen it comes to the potential economic fallout from the coronavirus , 74 % of Democrats think the outbreak will cause either a recession or a depression , compared with a smaller majority of Republicans ( 56 % ) who say this .\nViews of the ability of the medical system to handle the outbreak also differ by party . In the March 19-24 survey , Republicans express more confidence than Democrats that hospitals and medical centers could handle the needs of people who are seriously ill during the coronavirus outbreak .\n4 Similar shares of Republicans and Democrats say someone in their household has either lost a job or taken a pay cut . At this stage of the outbreak , 36 % of Democrats say that they or someone in their household has either lost a job or taken a pay cut because of the coronavirus outbreak . Slightly fewer Republicans ( 30 % ) say one or both of these negative job outcomes has happened to them or someone in their household .\n5 Republicans and Democrats differ on how people across the country are reacting to the outbreak . Relatively small shares of both Republicans ( 30 % ) and Democrats ( 27 % ) say ordinary people across the country are reacting about right to the coronavirus outbreak , but partisans differ in their critique of the public \u2019 s response .

Even as the coronavirus pandemic occupies our daily attention, out-of-control journalists are using the tragedy to pummel the President as personally culpable for the deaths and economic mayhem that are afflicting not just the United States, but nearly all of the nations of the Earth.\n\nWatch the following video for just a taste of how the liberal media are blaming Trump for the pandemic:\n\nIn fact, Trump\u2019s America appears to be faring better than many highly-equipped European nations: the U.K., France, Spain and Italy are suffering with per capita death rates much higher than that of the United States.\n\nEven many Democratic governors have found occasions to praise the President. \u201cHe has delivered for New York,\u201d the ubiquitous Andrew Cuomo told one radio host. \u201cI\u2019d be lying to you to say that he hasn\u2019t been responsive to our needs. He has,\u201d California\u2019s Gavin Newsom announced on CNN.\n\nYet TV talking heads insist Trump has blood on his hands.\n\n\u201cMore people are dead and dying in America tonight because Donald Trump is President,\u201d host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell asserted on MSNBC back on March 12. NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd invited Joe Biden to make the same charge on Meet the Press on March 29: \u201cDo you think there is blood on the President\u2019s hands?\u201d Even Biden had to tell Todd his question was \u201ca little too harsh.\u201d\n\nToo harsh for a Democratic partisan, perhaps, but not for the media. \u201cWhat is President Trump\u2019s level of culpability?\u201d former NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams impugned back on March 31. \u201cThere is death after death after death that is on the President\u2019s watch,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski slammed on her April 6 morning show. \u201cHow many people have to die?\u201d CNN\u2019s Don Lemon blasted that night. And on, and on, it goes.\n\nShameless.",

With time running out until this year \u2019 s address , Obama is getting busy on last year \u2019 s \u201c Promise. \u201d Obama today will re-tout the plan for tax incentives and targeted government spending for Southeastern Kentucky and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma , as well as blighted portions of San Antonio , Philadelphia and Los Angeles . Fox News has more .\nPASS NOW , PAY LATER - Pass the $ 6.4 billion unemployment benefits extension now and negotiate ways to offset it later , that \u2019 s the message Senior White House Adviser Dan Pfeiffer is giving to Republicans . Pfeiffer told USA Today that President Obama is willing to negotiate a \u2018 pay for \u2019 if both the House and Senate are willing to pass the measure that would extend unemployment benefits for another three months . \u201c That will give us three months to work out how to do it for the whole year , \u201d Pfeiffer said . However , even if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid does allow amendments many House Republicans are signaling they may not find the offsets palatable . Others are willing to make concessions in exchange for progress on The Keystone Pipeline XL .\n[ Watch Fox : Sen. Jack Reed , D-R.I. , discusses his unemployment bill in the 11 a.m . ET hour ]\n\u201c Transitional living fund \u201d - Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D-Texas , thinks welfare is a dirty word . In a floor speech , the Lone Star State Democrat said \u201c ... There are elements that many discard , the earned income tax credit , supplemental nutrition program , the huge job training and educational investment that President Johnson made on the war on poverty . Medicare and Medicaid . Huge safety nets , not handouts , but safety nets . Maybe the word welfare should be changed to something of a transitional living fund . For that is what it is , for people to be able to live . \u201d\n[ NYT examines how both parties are dealing with the issue of income inequality ahead of the 2014 midterms . ]\nOpportunity in opposition ? \u2013 Washington Examiner \u2019 s David Drucker points out why House Republicans are reluctant to support an extension of jobless benefits . \u201c If Republicans can successfully reframe the debate over unemployment benefits for voters , a crucial component of the Democrats \u2019 election-year strategy could be upended\u2026Republicans argue that Obama 's strategy wo n't box them into a political corner . Instead , they said , the president 's insistence on the dire need for additional jobless aid sends the message to voters that five years of his Democratic stewardship has failed to revive the economy . \u201d\nRUBIO LEADS COUNTERATTACK - As Democrats are making the president \u2019 s call for higher taxes and increased government spending to combat income inequality the centerpiece of their 2014 strategy , Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , criticized what 50 years of President Lyndon Johnson \u2019 s War on Poverty has meant . During a Wednesday speech , Rubio declared the war on poverty lost saying , \u201c Five decades and trillions of dollars after President Johnson waged his War on Poverty , the results of this big-government approach are in , we have four million Americans who have been out of work for six months or more. \u201d In a far reaching policy speech , the potential 2016 contender offered a proposal to consolidate welfare programs into one agency and provide those funds to the states . Rubio also announced he would he would introduce legislation that would that would eliminate the earned income tax credit and replace it with a federal wage enhancement for qualifying low-wage jobs . Hitting at Democratic proposals to raise the minimum wage Rubio stated , \u201c Raising the minimum wage may poll well , but having a job that pays $ 10 an hour is not the American Dream. \u201d WaPo has more .\nYou have a seat on the panel , next to Marco Rubio - Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , took the center seat on Wednesday \u2019 s \u201c Special Report with Bret Baier \u201d All-Star panel . As measured by Bing Pulse , Republicans , Democrats , and independents strongly agreed when Rubio \u2019 s stated , \u201c The problem is Washington right now is not conducive to doing big pieces of legislation. \u201d The Florida Republican cited several reasons why the middle class is struggling . Among them , he noted , is the disappearance of low-skilled jobs and lack of skills training . Men and women agreed when the first-term Senator pointed out that the erosion of marriage and family , with 70 percent of families in poverty being headed by single parents , is a result of \u201c cultural and social changes . \u201d\nDiscussion of the administration \u2019 s Iraq and Afghanistan strategy drew heightened viewer engagement .

Chris Christie, R-N.J., will hold a press conference this morning to answer the media uproar over newly revealed emails that show members of his staff intentionally caused traffic nightmares as payback to one of Christie\u2019s political foes. In a statement, Christie said he was misled by a member of his staff and is \u201coutraged and deeply saddened\u201d after newly released emails appear to show his Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly tried to create traffic gridlock in Fort Lee, N.J.. The string of e-mails published by the NYT reveal gleeful discussions Kelly had about the success of lane closures on the George Washington Bridge last September in retaliation for Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's refusal to endorse Christie\u2019s 2013 re-election bid. Christie maintains the behavior was \u201cunsanctioned\u201d and promises to hold people \u201cresponsible for their actions.\u201d Fox News has more.\n\n[Watch Fox: Christie meets the press at 11 a.m. ET today.]\n\nThe swarm - Like a New York pro athlete, Christie has a much higher profile nationally because of his proximity to the pulsating core of American media. But like the sometimes sensations over the Yankees or Jets, there can be a high price. The New York area media is in overdrive over the bridge flap, the NY Daily News calling it \u201cChristie\u2019s Waterloo\u201d and declaring conclusively that it will end Christie\u2019s career as a national figure, one way or another. Democrats have wasted no time jumping on the opportunity to use the issue to taint the potential 2016 GOP presidential contender\u2019s image as a bipartisan problem solver. But as long as the popular New Jersey governor isn\u2019t personally connected to the alleged local dirty tricks and his outrage is proven sincere, this will more likely be a data point in his rivals\u2019 inevitable character attacks on the brash boss.\n\n[Watch Fox: Correspondent Eric Shawn is following the latest developments in the Bridge-gate controversy.]\n\nWill it stick? - GOP Strategist Mike Murphy weighs the potential long term damage to Christie\u2019s nascent presidential campaign in a NY Daily News OpEd, \u201cThe story is irresistible to the political press\u2026 because the idea of New Jersey\u2019s bombastic governor dropping the gridlocking equivalent of a nuclear weapon on a small-time mayor easily fits a lazy narrative about Christie having a vindictive side\u2026 My prediction? The whole thing will blow over. Sure, the media will howl for a week and the mayor of Fort Lee will spend the next two years darkly plotting ways to poison Christie\u2019s good name in New Hampshire. But Christie has already blasted the main chortling staffer in question. The circus will move on.\u201d\n\nHistory repeating - Fox News Radio\u2019s White House Correspondent Mike Majchrowitz points out the historical precedent for bridge battles in the New York region\u2019s politics. Majchrowitz shares Mason William\u2019s work \u201cCity of Ambition\u201d which details a doozy of a battle involving President Franklin Roosevelt and New York Mayor Fiorello LaGaurdia over the Triborough Bridge during the Depression. LaGaurdia had appointed a bitter personal enemy of Roosevelt, Robert Moses, to a board that oversaw the construction of the construction of the bridge. Things got so tense that Public Works Administrator Harold Ickes summoned LaGaurdia to Washington to push Moses\u2019 removal from the board or risk federal funding that would put the project in jeopardy. The incident later prompted Roosevelt to say, \u201cIsn\u2019t the president of the United States entitled to one personal grudge?\u201d\n\nPRO-CORNYN PAC SMACKS STOCKMAN AS \u2018SHADY\u2019 - Texans for a Conservative Majority, a political action committee with close ties to Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has launched a new ad calling Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, \u201cshady.\u201d From the ad: \u201cLies. Shady deals. Ethical failings.

In an appearance Wednesday on \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d Maureen Faulkner told Kelly, \u201cTo have a man who defended a murderer, someone who murdered a police officer with premeditation and malice - is a radical, is a Black Panther... And to give him an appointment, to nominate him to the Department of justice, is a disgrace.\u201d The Fraternal Order of Police has written the administration to voice their opposition to Adegbile\u2019s nomination.

        "content": "How is it possible that Hillary Clinton escaped criminal indictment for mishandling classified documents despite incriminating evidence that she violated the Espionage Act ?\nWhy did Donald Trump become the target of a criminal investigation for allegedly conspiring with Russia to influence the presidential election despite no evidence that he ever did so ?\nThe answer , it seems , comes down to one person who played a vital role in both cases : Peter Strzok , deputy director of counterintelligence at the FBI .\nStrzok was exchanging politically charged texts with an FBI lawyer that denigrated Trump and lauded Clinton at the same time he was leading the bureau \u2019 s criminal investigation of Clinton . He is also the one who changed the critical wording of then-FBI Director James Comey \u2019 s description of Clinton \u2019 s handling of classified material that resulted in no charges being brought against her .\nThen , Strzok reportedly signed the document launching the 2016 investigation into Russia \u2019 s meddling in the election and whether the Trump campaign played any role . After leading the FBI \u2019 s probe into Trump , he then joined Robert Mueller \u2019 s special counsel team as an integral investigator .\nThus , it appears that one man with a strident political agenda accomplished his twin goals of clearing Clinton and accusing Trump , evidence be damned .\nThe Department of Justice inspector general , Michael Horowitz , discovered the electronic texts Strzok exchanged with his lover , FBI lawyer Lisa Page . The messages were so politically incendiary and so threatened the integrity of Mueller \u2019 s investigation that Strzok was quietly canned over the summer from the special counsel team , where he was a pivotal participant .\nDid Mueller or anyone else notify Congress that both the Trump investigation -- and the Clinton case before it -- were corrupted ? Of course not . This was covered up . Mueller surely knew that if the truth were revealed , it would further discredit a Trump-Russia probe that had already taken on the stench of dead fish .\nThe House Intelligence Committee could smell it and knew something was amiss . It demanded answers . But the Justice Department and the FBI refused to respond or otherwise produce relevant documents that the committee subpoenaed . They are still stonewalling many of Congress \u2019 s valid requests and should now face contempt charges .\nImportantly , all of the anti-Trump and pro-Clinton messages should be made public . Americans should decide for themselves whether our system of justice has been compromised by unscrupulous influences .\nJust how rife with political prejudice and corrupt motives is the special counsel \u2019 s investigation ?\nInstead of choosing prosecutors who could be neutral , fair and objective , Mueller stacked his staff with D emocratic donors . Apparently , he conducted little or no vetting of both prosecutors and investigators . How else does one explain the presence of Strzok and Lisa Page on the investigative team ?\nIt appears that Mueller selected people of a particular political persuasion without discerning review or scrutiny . We were supposed to simply trust Mueller \u2019 s judgment , notwithstanding his own disqualifying conflict of interest under the special counsel statute that demanded his recusal .\nThe Trump-Russia investigation is now awash in illegitimacy . Mueller and those who work for him have squandered all credibility . It is imperative that the special counsel be dismissed , the current staff fired , and a new counsel appointed to re-evaluate the evidence objectively .\nEvery member of Mueller \u2019 s hand-picked staff must now be examined . The special counsel has proven he can not be trusted with his assembled team of partisans .\nDo not expect Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to make these changes . He , too , should be removed in his capacity as Mueller \u2019 s supervisor . As both a witness and prosecutor , Rosenstein has his own conspicuous and disabling conflict of interest . Yet he has refused to step aside . Attorney General Jeff Sessions is duty-bound to remove both Mueller and Rosenstein .\nGiven what we know about the composition of the special counsel team , there may well be others who harbor a blatant political bias and have expressed their animus toward Trump in emails or texts . The computer accounts of the entire staff need to be examined by Congress and the DOJ Inspector General . Failing that , news organizations should file a request under the Freedom of Information Act .\nThe examination should begin with Andrew Weissmann , who has close ties to Hui Chen , whom he hired at the Justice Department and with whom he worked at the U.S. Attorney \u2019 s office for the Eastern District of New York . Documents show the DOJ approved a salary for her position of $ 711,800 for two years of work , which is more than the attorney general earns .\nChen resigned in June of this year , stating that she could no longer work in the administration of a president who had violated the Constitution and engaged in treasonous conduct . According to The Hill , she \u201c posted tweets or retweeted articles that were considered critical of Trump . \u201d\nBut before her departure , Chen attended a \u201c March for Truth \u201d rally and proudly posted on Twitter a photograph of herself outside the White House wearing an orange \u201c Resist \u201d jacket . She posted another photo of the Trump International Hotel with the words \u201c Pay Trump Bribery Here \u201d superimposed over the entrance .\nChen \u2019 s favored hashtag is \u201c TrumpRussiaCoverUp , \u201d and she has blanketed her Twitter account with virulent denunciations of the president . Hundreds of them .\nSince Chen made little secret of her views while at Justice , it is reasonable to ask whether she expressed them to Weissmann , the person to whom she reported . If so , how did he respond ? Like Strzok , did Weissmann write anti-Trump messages to his friend and colleague , Hui Chen , or others ?\nEvery member of Mueller \u2019 s hand-picked staff must now be examined . The special counsel has proven he can not be trusted with his assembled team of partisans .\nIt never made sense that Hillary Clinton escaped criminal prosecution for mishandling classified documents .\nThe Espionage Act makes it a crime to mishandle classified documents \u201c through gross negligence \u201d ( 18 USC 793-f ) . With 110 emails on Clinton \u2019 s private server that were classified at the time they were sent or received , only illogical legal gymnastics driven by corruption could clear her .\nEnter Strzok . It turns out , he is the person who altered former Director Comey 's early draft describing Clinton \u2019 s actions as criminal under the law . But later , the words \u201c grossly negligent \u201d were crossed out and the language \u201c extremely careless \u201d was substituted . Although the two terms are synonymous , the former terminology is specifically stated in the statute while the latter is not .\nIt appears that Strzok , and perhaps Comey , knew Clinton violated the law but subsequently resolved to conjure a way to exonerate her by editing the language so that it seemed less culpable and more innocuous . Were these machinations driven by Strzok \u2019 s political agenda ? Did he despise Trump so much that he devised a scheme to clear Clinton so that a criminal indictment would not impede her assent to the presidency ?\nStrzok , Comey and others who may have been involved must be put under oath to answer these vital questions .\nIn the meantime , the Department of Justice must now , belatedly , reopen the Clinton email case and re-examine fairly and impartially all of the evidence to determine whether criminal charges against her should be sought . The statute of limitations has not expired .\nSadly , the FBI is no longer the respected premier law enforcement agency in America . People like Strzok have politicized the bureau , discredited its work and done immeasurable damage . So , too , have Comey and Mueller .\nPresident Trump is right \u2013the FBI \u2019 s \u201c reputation is in tatters , \u201d and the Clinton probe was \u201c phony and dishonest . \u201d",

Americans should decide for themselves whether our system of justice has been compromised by unscrupulous influences.\n\nJust how rife with political prejudice and corrupt motives is the special counsel\u2019s investigation?\n\nInstead of choosing prosecutors who could be neutral, fair and objective, Mueller stacked his staff with D emocratic donors . Apparently, he conducted little or no vetting of both prosecutors and investigators. How else does one explain the presence of Strzok and Lisa Page on the investigative team?\n\nIt appears that Mueller selected people of a particular political persuasion without discerning review or scrutiny. We were supposed to simply trust Mueller\u2019s judgment, notwithstanding his own disqualifying conflict of interest under the special counsel statute that demanded his recusal.\n\nThe Trump-Russia investigation is now awash in illegitimacy. Mueller and those who work for him have squandered all credibility. It is imperative that the special counsel be dismissed, the current staff fired, and a new counsel appointed to re-evaluate the evidence objectively.\n\nEvery member of Mueller\u2019s hand-picked staff must now be examined. The special counsel has proven he cannot be trusted with his assembled team of partisans.\n\nDo not expect Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to make these changes. He, too, should be removed in his capacity as Mueller\u2019s supervisor. As both a witness and prosecutor, Rosenstein has his own conspicuous and disabling conflict of interest. Yet he has refused to step aside. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is duty-bound to remove both Mueller and Rosenstein.\n\nAre There Other Emails?\n\nGiven what we know about the composition of the special counsel team, there may well be others who harbor a blatant political bias and have expressed their animus toward Trump in emails or texts. The computer accounts of the entire staff need to be examined by Congress and the DOJ Inspector General. Failing that, news organizations should file a request under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe examination should begin with Andrew Weissmann, who has close ties to Hui Chen, whom he hired at the Justice Department and with whom he worked at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York. Documents show the DOJ approved a salary for her position of $711,800 for two years of work, which is more than the attorney general earns.\n\nChen resigned in June of this year, stating that she could no longer work in the administration of a president who had violated the Constitution and engaged in treasonous conduct. According to The Hill , she \u201cposted tweets or retweeted articles that were considered critical of Trump.\u201d\n\nBut before her departure, Chen attended a \u201cMarch for Truth\u201d rally and proudly posted on Twitter a photograph of herself outside the White House wearing an orange \u201cResist\u201d jacket. She posted another photo of the Trump International Hotel with the words \u201cPay Trump Bribery Here\u201d superimposed over the entrance.\n\nChen\u2019s favored hashtag is \u201cTrumpRussiaCoverUp,\u201d and she has blanketed her Twitter account with virulent denunciations of the president. Hundreds of them.\n\nSince Chen made little secret of her views while at Justice, it is reasonable to ask whether she expressed them to Weissmann, the person to whom she reported. If so, how did he respond? Like Strzok, did Weissmann write anti-Trump messages to his friend and colleague, Hui Chen, or others?\n\nEvery member of Mueller\u2019s hand-picked staff must now be examined. The special counsel has proven he cannot be trusted with his assembled team of partisans.\n\nThe Sham Investigation of Clinton\n\nIt never made sense that Hillary Clinton escaped criminal prosecution for mishandling classified documents.\n\nThe Espionage Act makes it a crime to mishandle classified documents \u201cthrough gross negligence\u201d (18 USC 793-f). With 110 emails on Clinton\u2019s private server that were classified at the time they were sent or received, only illogical legal gymnastics driven by corruption could clear her.\n\nEnter Strzok. It turns out, he is the person who altered former Director Comey's early draft describing Clinton\u2019s actions as criminal under the law. But later, the words \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d were crossed out and the language \u201cextremely careless\u201d was substituted. Although the two terms are synonymous, the former terminology is specifically stated in the statute while the latter is not.\n\nIt appears that Strzok, and perhaps Comey, knew Clinton violated the law but subsequently resolved to conjure a way to exonerate her by editing the language so that it seemed less culpable and more innocuous. Were these machinations driven by Strzok\u2019s political agenda? Did he despise Trump so much that he devised a scheme to clear Clinton so that a criminal indictment would not impede her assent to the presidency?\n\nStrzok, Comey and others who may have been involved must be put under oath to answer these vital questions.\n\nIn the meantime, the Department of Justice must now, belatedly, reopen the Clinton email case and re-examine fairly and impartially all of the evidence to determine whether criminal charges against her should be sought. The statute of limitations has not expired.\n\nSadly, the FBI is no longer the respected premier law enforcement agency in America. People like Strzok have politicized the bureau, discredited its work and done immeasurable damage. So, too, have Comey and Mueller.\n\nPresident Trump is right \u2013the FBI\u2019s \u201creputation is in tatters,\u201d and the Clinton probe was \u201cphony and dishonest.\u201d",

In both cases, life is supremely toxic and just plain in the way.\n\nWe are the most educated a people has ever been in the history of the world, in terms of the amount of time the children of Western Civilization have spent in formal school training. Yet that has come with the undeniable price of devaluing most notions of innate human value in exchange for only transactional worth. And the price of each pagan transaction keeps getting steeper and steeper.\n\nGreta and her throng are here to tell you that the current going price is pretty much set at Kamikaze mode.

        "content": "Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York is a textbook taqiyya Democrat : She presented herself as a moderate when representing a relatively conservative House district and now , after pronouncing herself \u201c ashamed \u201d of her previously moderate positions on issues such as gun rights , she is doing a pretty good impersonation of a left-wing radical , most recently by calling for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , the sister agency to the U.S. Border Patrol charged with overseeing the deportation of illegal aliens , among other duties .\nAbolishing ICE is the Democratic cause du jour , part of the party \u2019 s current rush to the left . Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , the self-described socialist who won a Democratic House primary over party-caucus chairman Joe Crowley in New York in June , ran as much against ICE as she did against President Donald Trump and Representative Crowley . A petition in California calls for the abolition of the agency ; Representatives Mark Pocan , Pramila Jayapal , and Adriano Espaillat ( Democrats of Wisconsin , Washington , and New York , respectively ) have introduced legislation to dissolve it ; Representative Yvette D. Clarke ( a New York Democrat ) denounced the agency as \u201c the Gestapo of the United States of America , \u201d and Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo described ICE as a \u201c rogue agency. \u201d Sean McElwee of Data for Progress , an early and tireless advocate of abolishing the agency , wrote in The Nation : \u201c The call to abolish ICE is , above all , a demand for the Democratic party to begin seriously resisting an unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state that it had a hand in creating . \u201d\nMara Liasson of National Public Radio wrote : \u201c Many Democratic strategists were asking why \u2014 just when the Democrats were winning the immigration debate \u2014 they should adopt a slogan that could backfire on them going into the midterm elections. \u201d But what \u2019 s in question is not merely a slogan . It is a rhetoric , true , but it also is a genuine worldview , one that equates those charged with enforcing U.S. immigration law with the Nazi secret police and insists that the act of law enforcement itself is a \u201c white supremacist \u201d undertaking , propositions that may not do very much to help Democrats win back those Rust Belt voters who turned to Donald Trump in 2016 . Democrats are settling on a strategy of meeting Trump \u2019 s purported radicalism with radicalism of their own rather than with Clintonian triangulation and difference-splitting .\nIn a sense , that is the Democrats \u2019 perverse tribute to President Trump . On key initiatives such as judicial appointments and corporate-tax reform , Trump has governed in more or less the same way that a President Scott Walker or a President Marco Rubio might have , but he is a rhetorical maximalist , a full-time Kulturkampf commando . The Republicans \u2019 problem in 2016 was that Larry Kudlow \u2019 s people had the power but Sean Hannity \u2019 s people had the numbers , and they \u2019 d heard all they wanted to hear from the Chamber of Commerce . The Democrats \u2019 problem in 2018 ( and , most important , in 2020 ) is similar : that theirs is a party in which rich , elderly white people call the shots and young brown people with a hell of a lot less money do the work . They want Democratic leaders who will offer them what Trump offered Republicans in 2016 : politics without mercy , and without caution .\nOf course abolishing ICE is a batty idea , but , then , so have been Republican calls to abolish ( pay attention now , Rick Perry ) the IRS , the Department of Energy , the Department of Education , the Department of Commerce , etc . Calls to abolish departments sound good \u2014 they sound radical , which is approximately the same thing in our current angry political moment \u2014 but they generally are foolish or meaningless . What \u2019 s important is not dissolving agencies but dissolving programs .\nConsider the Department of Energy . It irritates some conservatives , as Vox \u2019 s Matthew Yglesias put it , because it \u201c was established during Jimmy Carter \u2019 s administration and it perhaps sounds like it might have something to do with solar panels. \u201d DOE did indeed emerge from the neo-Malthusian terror of the late 1960s and early 1970s , back when Population Bomb author Paul Ehrlich was promising that \u201c in the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now . At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate. \u201d DOE is sometimes used as an instrument of industrial policy , which Republicans don \u2019 t like except when they \u2019 re in charge of it , and it suffers from the same ailments that afflict any comparable federal bureaucracy . But if you drive past Pantex , the facility just outside Amarillo where many of the nation \u2019 s nuclear weapons are assembled and serviced , you \u2019 re looking at an important part of DOE \u2019 s portfolio \u2014 one that isn \u2019 t going away so long as we have nuclear weapons . DOE maintains its own little special-forces operation , the Federal Protective Forces , who are charged with defending nuclear facilities , responding to nuclear incidents , and tracking down stolen nuclear materials . Those tasks aren \u2019 t going away , either . Perhaps they could be consolidated with other defense operations , but very seldom has anybody ever spoken the words \u201c That would be done a lot more efficiently if we put the Pentagon in charge of it . \u201d\nThe Department of Education does a lot of squishy and destructive stuff , too , and eliminating those programs would be worthwhile . But it also administers Pell grants , college aid , and veterans \u2019 programs that few if any Republicans are serious about eliminating . The IRS is a ghastly and corrupt agency , and one might make a case for abolishing it on the grounds that it is institutionally irredeemable , which is of course the argument the Democrats are making against ICE . But if the IRS were abolished tomorrow , somebody \u2014 maybe we could contract the job out to the Swiss \u2014 would be put in charge of collecting the taxes . And whoever ends up collecting the taxes will probably have many or most of the same powers as the IRS , the same institutional incentives , the same potential for abuse , and the same problems .\nWe want to collect taxes . Do we want to enforce immigration laws ?\nTalk-radio rhetoric notwithstanding , there are very few plain and thoroughgoing supporters of genuinely open borders on either side of the political divide . Open borders are not without historical precedent ( immigrants arriving in Victorian England did not need so much as a passport stamp , and the United States itself had effectively open borders for many years ) but are not really on the agenda in this age of terror and overreaction to terror .\nWhat is in the offing is the decriminalization of unauthorized entry into the United States \u2014 and all that angst and wailing about children of illegal immigrants separated from their incarcerated parents , like the call to abolish ICE , is really a stalking-horse for that issue . Senator Gillibrand et al . are serious about abolishing the law-enforcement agency responsible for immigration issues because they do not really believe that illegal immigration should be a criminal-justice issue at all , but rather think it should be closer to a civil offense ( which is what overstaying a visa is , under current law ) or a bookkeeping issue .\nThe bill abolishing ICE would establish the inevitable blue-ribbon commission to study the agency \u2019 s core responsibilities and how they should be carried out in a post-ICE world . Senator Gillibrand owes her constituents a straight answer about whether apprehending and deporting illegal aliens is in fact a core responsibility of those charged with enforcing U.S. immigration laws . If it is , then she ought to explain why apprehending and deporting illegal immigrants ( some of whom will have children ) would be less horrifying and scandalous if it were handled by an agency not called \u201c ICE. \u201d If it isn \u2019 t \u2014 which is to say , if our national government is to abandon the task of apprehending and deporting those present in the United States illegally \u2014 then Senator Gillibrand and her Democratic colleagues should say so honestly and take that case to the voters .\nDemocrats may take seriously the bumper-sticker slogan \u201c No Person Is Illegal. \u201d Beto O \u2019 Rourke , the Democrat running against Senator Ted Cruz in Texas , has shown himself awfully wormy on the question , insisting that he is \u201c open to doing whatever it takes \u201d to reform immigration practices but unwilling to endorse ICE \u2019 s abolition even as he left unchallenged a Houston activist \u2019 s insistence that the agency is a \u201c terroristic organization , \u201d a charge also made by Cynthia Nixon , who is running for governor of New York . In July , the House of Representatives considered a bill expressing support for the law-enforcement personnel responsible for investigating and policing illegal immigration .\nBeto O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s yard-sign game is tight , but if he can not explain the difference between law enforcement and terrorism , then he and his fellow Democrats are simply playing make-believe . Cynthia Nixon is excellent on that score , but one suspects that the voters of Texas \u2014 and New York , and Wisconsin , and Washington \u2014 may be less inclined to sit back and enjoy the show . And they might keep in mind that the born-again fire-breather Kirsten Gillibrand used to pretend to be a moderate , too .",

The combined ICE-led operation rounded up 114 undocumented immigrants workers ; some of whom had been here on and off for decades .\nThe raid lay bare the essential dilemma facing those attempting to enforce our immigration policy . It took a gigantic federal operation to round up and hold for deportation people who were working hard and attempting to do the right thing . No matter how you slice it , our massive , legitimate , law-enforcement operation punished good people trying to work and provide for their families .\nBear the Corso raid in mind when you try to wrap your mind around the current crisis involving the Caravan of Migrants doggedly heading our way from Guatemala and Honduras , trudging through Mexico and causing great consternation and angry condemnation in Washington , D.C .\nIt would be easy to support the deployment of the U.S. military and other draconian \u201c solutions \u201d to the migrant crisis generally , and the caravan specifically , if the marchers were gang bangers or ISIS recruits . Manifestly most are not , ( unless ISIS or MS-13 is recruiting crying , hungry three-year olds ) . Even the most hardened anti-immigrant pundit can not justify actions taken to stop the caravan by saying it is mostly about national security . It is not .\nIt is , in my opinion , fear of our nation being over-run by poor , hungry , brown people in sufficient numbers to change our basic national character , which motivates most critics of this caravan and , more broadly , illegal immigration .\nWhat would the Army do against a caravan of civilians , many of them women and children , anyway ? Shoot them ?\nThe president senses that most Americans are responding very negatively to the caravan , and even see it as an existential threat to the nation . He has even stated that he will , if necessary , use our military to stop the caravan from crossing over the southern border . In doing so he ignores the principle known as Posse Comitatus , which by law , prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws .\nWhat would the Army do against a caravan of civilians , many of them women and children , anyway ? Shoot them ?\nThe Republicans see this caravan as the perfect issue to rally the base and insure a big , robust turnout for the mid-term elections now two weeks away . Democrats would like to pretend that the caravan is just a giant day-care center filled with needy children that the heartless president doesn \u2019 t care about .\nThis crisis calls for reason , patience , compassion and an immediate parlay among the affected nations in Central America , Mexico and the United States . In exchange for leniency and a path to citizenship for long-time undocumented residents already in this country -- who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents -- pro-immigration advocates , like me , should announce our support for President Trump \u2019 s border wall . It will help restore order along the southern border , and mitigate the hysteria currently gripping the national immigration debate and tainting the mid-term elections .\nBut neither building the president \u2019 s border wall , nor compassion for the DREAMERS already here , will fully solve the crisis of immigration . We are the world \u2019 s richest country . We are located adjacent to some of the world \u2019 s poorest and most violent countries . As long as that imbalance exists , they will want to come here .\nAnd neither the Army nor the wall will stop them all .",

In doing so he ignores the principle known as Posse Comitatus, which by law, prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws.\n\nWhat would the Army do against a caravan of civilians, many of them women and children, anyway? Shoot them?\n\nThe Republicans see this caravan as the perfect issue to rally the base and insure a big, robust turnout for the mid-term elections now two weeks away. Democrats would like to pretend that the caravan is just a giant day-care center filled with needy children that the heartless president doesn\u2019t care about.\n\nThis crisis calls for reason, patience, compassion and an immediate parlay among the affected nations in Central America, Mexico and the United States. In exchange for leniency and a path to citizenship for long-time undocumented residents already in this country--who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents--pro-immigration advocates, like me, should announce our support for President Trump\u2019s border wall. It will help restore order along the southern border, and mitigate the hysteria currently gripping the national immigration debate and tainting the mid-term elections.\n\nBut neither building the president\u2019s border wall, nor compassion for the DREAMERS already here, will fully solve the crisis of immigration. We are the world\u2019s richest country. We are located adjacent to some of the world\u2019s poorest and most violent countries. As long as that imbalance exists, they will want to come here.\n\nAnd neither the Army nor the wall will stop them all.",

He will do a great job!\"\n\nTrump wrote Sunday night that the agency's acting director, Matt Albence, would remain in his job until Morgan is confirmed. \u201cMatt is tough and dedicated and has my full support to deploy ICE to the maximum extent of the law!\u201d\n\nMorgan has been critical of attempts \u2013 of the lack thereof -- by Congress to end the migration crisis at the U.S.\u2019 southern border with Mexico.\n\nMARK MORGAN: TRUMP CRITICS SAY THERE'S NO EMERGENCY AT THE BORDER. THE NUMBERS SHOW THEY ARE WRONG\n\nSpeaking on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d last week, Morgan said that Congress has \u201cshown again and again their failure to do what\u2019s right\u201d to fix the problem.\n\n\u201cThey want to eat the elephant in one bite instead of looking at what they need to do right now,\u201d he said.\n\nMorgan said what Congress should be doing is fixing the so-called Flores Settlement, which prevents migrant families and children caught crossing the border illegally from being detained for more than 20 days.\n\nMorgan also said during a previous interview on Fox News that he supports an idea floated by President Trump to send immigrants from the border to sanctuary cities.\n\n\u201cBorder Patrol, ICE, their facilities are overwhelmed, the faith-based organizations and other non-governmental organizations are overwhelmed,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThey have no choice. They\u2019re going to have to start pushing these individuals out. Shouldn't we kind of share the burden throughout the country?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMorgan, who served in the last six months of the Obama administration and a seemingly unlikely source of support for President Trump, said in response, \u201cI\u2019m here and I've broken my silence for one reason: because it\u2019s fact.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat the president is saying and what they're trying to do as far as the policy goes, it\u2019s based on reality and fact and I know that because he\u2019s listening to the experts. Not political pundits, not talking heads, he is listening to experts.

( Simon Dawson/Reuters )\nAfter what seem like years of a phony war , British and European Union negotiators finally agreed on the terms of Britain \u2019 s departure from the EU earlier this week , and Theresa May announced it in the House of Commons . The deal covers more than 500 pages of legal and bureaucratic prose , and few but the negotiators have read it in full .

Battle lines are therefore now being drawn in U.K. politics for and against both May and the deal . Brexit \u2019 s strongest supporters in Parliament , such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg , denounce the deal as outright betrayal . They therefore act on the logic that if the leader won \u2019 t change the deal , then they must change the leader .

And that threatens the Union \u2014 not the European Union but the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .\nMay and her loyalist supporters therefore face three linked challenges : a possible leadership vote , a possible parliamentary defeat on the EU\u2013U.K . deal , and a possible election to resolve the Brexit solution . In short , Britain is in the midst of a full-bore political crisis . Several cabinet ministers , including May \u2019 s second secretary of state for Brexit , have resigned . A further five have let it be known that they are staying in the cabinet only to obtain changes in the deal .

If she holds on as leader but loses the vote on the deal because of Tory dissent , she \u2019 s almost certainly out then also . A leader who spends two full years not getting Brexit done will find her support evaporating .

The first is that the Conservative party below the cabinet level is a Leaver party \u2014 as opinion polls and election statistics both show clearly . She would be leading a bitterly divided party into an election on an issue on which her natural voters are against her . That would be the culmination of her original error on Brexit \u2014 which has been to allow herself to be maneuvered by a faction of Remainer ministers , civil servants , and establishment worthies into a Brexit strategy at odds with the great majority of her own party .

As in the last election , she would be reduced to helpless silence .\nThere is no good end to this crisis under May \u2019 s leadership or on the basis of this dangerous and undemocratic deal . The Tories should find the courage and commonsense to choose a new leader who would then have the authority to forge a new policy to achieve a real Brexit .

As in the last election, she would be reduced to helpless silence.\n\nThere is no good end to this crisis under May\u2019s leadership or on the basis of this dangerous and undemocratic deal. The Tories should find the courage and commonsense to choose a new leader who would then have the authority to forge a new policy to achieve a real Brexit. At present they are sleepwalking into vassalage.",

Ilhan Omar , a Democratic freshman from Minnesota , was forced to apologize for her latest foray into anti-Semitism , which triggered a widespread outcry -- including from many members of her own party . She clearly suggested that pro-Israel support among American leaders is fueled by financial interest , promulgating the well-worn anti-Semitic trope that Jewish money controls people in power and buys politicians ' loyalties .

        "content_original": "Yesterday, Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democratic freshman from Minnesota, was forced to apologize for her latest foray into anti-Semitism, which triggered a widespread outcry -- including from many members of her own party. She clearly suggested that pro-Israel support among American leaders is fueled by financial interest, promulgating the well-worn anti-Semitic trope that Jewish money controls people in power and buys politicians' loyalties. When challenged over her bigoted comment, she confirmed that was exactly what she'd meant, specifically naming a nonpartisan Israel advocacy organization, comprised of American Jews, as the culprit. This touched off even more criticism; the angry chorus grew louder and louder, finally reaching such a crescendo that House Democrats' leadership team publicly called for an apology, referring to Omar's tweet as a \"deeply offensive\" deployment of anti-Semitic \"prejudicial accusations.\" It isn't the first time she's done something like this.

        "content": "Iran successfully test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile capable of striking U.S. forces in the region as well as Israel , the third such test since the nuclear agreement with Western nations took effect in January , multiple defense officials confirmed to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe rogue nation conducted the test in defiance of a United Nations resolution that calls on Iran to cease work on its ballistic missile program .\n\u201c Iran has to abide by U.N. resolutions with regard to ballistic missiles tests , and if they have violated or not been consistent with those resolutions , that clearly would be a concern for us , \u201d Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said .\nAny ballistic missile launch by Iran is tracked by U.S. military spy satellites which pick up the flash during launch . This case was no different , according to officials .\nGen. Ali Abdollahi , deputy chief of the armed forces ' headquarters , said the latest missile tested is very accurate , within 8 meters . `` Eight meters means nothing , it means it 's without any error , '' he said . He did not elaborate .\nIn March , Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles -- one emblazoned with the phrase `` Israel must be wiped out '' in Hebrew -- that set off an international outcry .\nSince December , Iran has shipped out its low-enriched uranium , disabled its heavy water reactor in Arak , and weeks ago sold more than $ 8 million worth of heavy water to the U.S. in compliance with the nuclear deal . However , Iran has ignored separate U.N. resolutions barring the Islamic republic from ballistic missile tests . \u2588\u2588\u2588 was first to report a secret Iranian ballistic missile launch in November .\nThe test-firing was carried out two weeks ago , Iran 's semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Abdollahi as saying . Tasnim is close to the country 's powerful Revolutionary Guard , which is in charge of Iranian ballistic missiles program .\nThe agency said the missile has a range of 1,250 miles -- enough to reach much of the Middle East .

        "content_original": "Iran successfully test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile capable of striking U.S. forces in the region as well as Israel, the third such test since the nuclear agreement with Western nations took effect in January, multiple defense officials confirmed to Fox News.\n\nThe rogue nation conducted the test in defiance of a United Nations resolution that calls on Iran to cease work on its ballistic missile program.\n\n\u201cIran has to abide by U.N. resolutions with regard to ballistic missiles tests, and if they have violated or not been consistent with those resolutions, that clearly would be a concern for us,\u201d Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said.\n\nAny ballistic missile launch by Iran is tracked by U.S. military spy satellites which pick up the flash during launch. This case was no different, according to officials.\n\nGen. Ali Abdollahi, deputy chief of the armed forces' headquarters, said the latest missile tested is very accurate, within 8 meters. \"Eight meters means nothing, it means it's without any error,\" he said. He did not elaborate.\n\nIn March, Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles -- one emblazoned with the phrase \"Israel must be wiped out\" in Hebrew -- that set off an international outcry.\n\nSince December, Iran has shipped out its low-enriched uranium, disabled its heavy water reactor in Arak, and weeks ago sold more than $8 million worth of heavy water to the U.S. in compliance with the nuclear deal. However, Iran has ignored separate U.N. resolutions barring the Islamic republic from ballistic missile tests. Fox News was first to report a secret Iranian ballistic missile launch in November.\n\nThe test-firing was carried out two weeks ago, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Abdollahi as saying. Tasnim is close to the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard, which is in charge of Iranian ballistic missiles program.\n\nThe agency said the missile has a range of 1,250 miles -- enough to reach much of the Middle East. Iranian military commanders have described them as a strategic asset and a strong deterrent, capable of hitting U.S. bases or Israel in the event of a strike on Iran.\n\nAnalysts say Iran is likely seeking to demonstrate it is making progress with its ballistic program, despite scaling back on the nuclear program following the deal that led to the lifting of international sanction on Tehran.\n\nLast month, Gen.

        "content_original": "President Barack Obama on Saturday blamed the border crisis for his delay in taking executive action on immigration reform, saying \"the truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer.\"\n\n\"I want to spend some time, even as we're getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, \u2026 to make sure that the public understands why we're doing this, why it's the right thing for the American people, why it's the right thing for the American economy,\" Obama told Chuck Todd on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" The interview, which marks Todd's debut as host of the venerable news program, will be broadcast on Sunday. Todd, the network's chief White House correspondent, replaced the embattled David Gregory, who was ousted last month.President Obama said on Saturday that he would delay taking unilateral action on immigration until after the November congressional elections. The decision enraging reform advocates and led Republicans to charge that Obama was acting merely to protect the Democrats from losing the Senate.More than 67,000 illegal immigrant minors have been apprehended at the U.S. Border since Oct. 1, with the administration estimating that as many as 90,000 could be taken into custody by the end of the month.Obama has termed the situation \"a humanitarian crisis,\" while Republicans have attacked the White House for creating the situation with its lax enforcement of immigration policy.The president made the decision to delay taking action as he returned Friday to Washington from a NATO summit in Wales, according to two White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He called a few allies from Air Force One to inform them of his decision, the officials said, and then called others from the White House on Saturday.In his NBC interview, Obama denied that he delayed executive action to protect vulnerable Democrats seeking re-election this fall. \"That's not the reason,\" he responded when Todd suggested it in a question.\"I have been consistent about why this is important,\" Obama said. \"The country's going to be better off if we have an immigration system that works \u2014 that has strong border security, that has streamlined our legal immigration \u2014 so the best and the brightest who want to stay here and invest here and create jobs here can do so.He added that the immigration system would be reformed such that \"families can be unified \u2014 and that a system where the millions of people who are here, in many cases, for a decade or more \u2014 who have American kids, who are neighbors, oftentimes, are our friends \u2014 that they have a path to get legal.Such a system, he added, would have illegals \"paying taxes and getting above board, paying a fine, learning English,\" Obama said.\"The good news is we have bipartisan support for that,\" the president added, referring to the Gang of Eight comprehensive reform bill pass last year by the Senate. He blamed the stalemate on Republicans in the House of Representatives.\"The House Republicans refuse to do that. And what I said to them was: 'If you do not act on something that's so common sense that you've got labor, business, evangelicals, law enforcement, you've got folks across the board supporting it, then I'm going to look for all the legal authorities I have to act.' \"This all changed, however, with the border crisis, the president said.\"I'm being honest now about the politics of it,\" Obama began. \"This problem with unaccompanied children that we saw a couple weeks ago, where you had, from Central America, a surge of kids who were showing up at the border, got a lot of attention.\"And a lot of Americans started thinking, 'We've got this immigration crisis on our hands,'\" Obama said.He noted that fewer illegals have been arrested at the border in recent months \u2014 \"it's far lower than it was 10 years ago,\" he said \u2014 and that many of the illegal minors have been placed with sponsors in the U.S.\"But that's not the impression on people's minds,\" Obama told Todd. \"And what I want to do is, when I take executive action, I want to make sure that it's sustainable.\"He said that he has received preliminary proposals from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, \"and what I've determined is that I want to make sure we get it right.\"I'm going to act because it's the right thing for the country,\" President Obama said. \"But it's going to be more sustainable and more effective if the public understands what the facts are on immigration, what we've done on unaccompanied children, and why it's necessary.\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Friday on ABC \u2019 s \u201c Good Morning America , \u201d presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump fielded questions from co-host George Stephanopoulos about his releasing his tax returns to the public .\nDuring that interview , Stephanopoulos insisted Trump could release those taxes , despite being audited by the Internal Revenue Service . Trump argued there was a double standard when it came to his tax returns and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails .\nHowever , as Stephanopoulos continued to press Trump on the issue , Trump fired back by pointing out Stephanopoulos \u2019 prior relationship with the Bill and Hillary Clinton and noted it was something he didn \u2019 t reveal .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : Let \u2019 s talk about your tax return . Under new pressure from the Clinton campaign , Secretary Clinton talking about that the last couple of days . I just have a bottom line question for you . Yes or no , do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision ?\nTRUMP : I don \u2019 t think they do . But I do say this , I will really gladly give them \u2014 not going to learn anything but it \u2019 s under routine audit . When the audit ends I \u2019 ll present them . That should be before the election . I hope it \u2019 s before the election . But when the audit ends I \u2019 ve had even journalists say that , no , nobody should give until audits are over and have had journalists say that . So I think if there \u2019 s no \u2014 I sort of have to laugh when Clinton says it , Mrs. Clinton said I should give my tax what about all the emails or missing Goldman Sachs speeches . When is she going to give that ?

        "content_original": "Friday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump fielded questions from co-host George Stephanopoulos about his releasing his tax returns to the public.\n\nDuring that interview, Stephanopoulos insisted Trump could release those taxes, despite being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Trump argued there was a double standard when it came to his tax returns and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nHowever, as Stephanopoulos continued to press Trump on the issue, Trump fired back by pointing out Stephanopoulos\u2019 prior relationship with the Bill and Hillary Clinton and noted it was something he didn\u2019t reveal.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let\u2019s talk about your tax return. Under new pressure from the Clinton campaign, Secretary Clinton talking about that the last couple of days. I just have a bottom line question for you. Yes or no, do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t think they do. But I do say this, I will really gladly give them \u2014 not going to learn anything but it\u2019s under routine audit. When the audit ends I\u2019ll present them. That should be before the election. I hope it\u2019s before the election. But when the audit ends I\u2019ve had even journalists say that, no, nobody should give until audits are over and have had journalists say that. So I think if there\u2019s no \u2014 I sort of have to laugh when Clinton says it, Mrs. Clinton said I should give my tax what about all the emails or missing Goldman Sachs speeches. When is she going to give that? Very great hypocrite but as far as I\u2019m concerned I want to give it as soon as possible, as soon as the audit every year \u2014 I have wealthy friends that never get audited.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: As you know the audit is no excuse.

If you look at many others, many others feel the same way and almost every lawyer will tell you the same thing \u2013when you\u2019re under audit you finish the audit before you release. I have no problem and it should be and I hope it\u2019s before the election.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But sir, if you were willing \u2013\n\nTRUMP: By the way, people will learn nothing. I put in financials 100 pages worth of financials that show that I built a company that\u2019s worth more than $10 billion. It shows cash. It shows cash flows. Returns but nevertheless, when the audit is complete, i will release. I have no problem with it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: A couple of follow-ups to that.

There have been many presidents that have not shown their tax returns.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Actually every single nominee before 1976 \u2013\n\nTRUMP: Before 1976, people didn\u2019t do it. It used to be a secret thing. I don\u2019t want it to be secret, but I do want the audit to get finished.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Before that Richard Nixon released his returns as I said, but to get to your point on the one hand you show that stack and on the other hand you say people can\u2019t learn anything.

        "content": "The United States has 328 million people . We have some of the most educated and creative minds in the world . But in 2020 , amid numerous crises , the two major political parties appear to be nominating for president , individuals so exceptionally flawed , that all one can ask is \u2013 can \u2019 t we find someone better than these two ?\nHas the U.S. transitioned into a Kakistocracy \u2013 rule by the least able or least principled citizens ?\nThe Democrats are about to nominate a man referred to as \u201c Sleepy Joe Biden. \u201d He is gaffe prone ; decades of gaffes insulting blacks , Indians , women , disabled\u2014to name a few . He also has a lifetime of plagiarism starting with law school papers and continuing on to Senate floor speeches and presidential campaigns .\nThe Republicans are about to re-nominate a man described by behavioral scientists as a perfect example of a \u201c narcissist \u201c . A grandiose self-image . An inflated ego . A continuous need for attention . A big urge to be admired . And if that admiration is lacking or the narcissist is criticized ( which is even worse ) , he lashes out recklessly .\nOnly 1 in 10 adults believe the two-party system works . Gallup finds 57 % of Americans say a new major political party is needed . The Pew Research Center report finds : \u201c Public trust in the government remains near historic lows . Only 17 % of Americans today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right \u201c just about always \u201d ( 3 % ) or \u201c most of the time \u201d ( 14 % ) . \u201d\nA Real Clear average of polls for April 2020 finds only 35.1 % of Americans believe the country is on the \u201c right-track \u201d whereas 57.7 % believe it is on the \u201c wrong-track . \u201d\nHow did two political parties limit political competition to such an extent that they secured complete control of the government of the United States ?\nThe Republican and Democratic parties manipulate election laws to ensure one of their loyalists almost always wins the election . Controlling who wins directly translates into what laws are enacted , which citizens or corporations receive subsidies , who is taxed more or taxed less , how commerce is regulated and who will judge us should we violate any command .\nAccording to David Nir , in an article in the Daily Kos that references Becoming a Candidate , a book by Jennifer Lawless , there are 519,682 elected officeholders in the United States . Of this total the Libertarian Party , in 2017 , claims 168 of these officeholders ; the Green Party in 2016 held 143 offices , and the Constitution Party holds 12 offices . Many of these positions are non-partisan offices . There are also , at least 26 Independent office holders , including 2 U.S . Senators who caucus with the Democrats , and 26 Democratic Vermont Progressives . A basic calculation places the third-party competitors \u2019 share of the political market at 0.0007215 % .\nWhat makes the power of the two major parties so baffling is that political parties are not mentioned in our Constitution . In fact , for the first several years of our Republic , there were no political parties .\nA political party is merely a corporation designed to take control of government\nPolitical parties are nothing more than highly organized , demographically diverse , nonprofit associations of individuals , arranged in a corporate structure , for the sole purpose of controlling all government in the United States and by extension , us . This duopoly , through its many affiliates , has officers in every nook and cranny in the nation to ensure that a member of one of two major parties occupies every seat in government .\nBeyond excluding citizens , with different political viewpoints , from participating in the governing of the nation , Republicans and Democrats turn representative government on its head . Instead of allowing citizens to vote for a person who will serve as a fiduciary loyal to the Constitution and citizens ; the two major parties use their massive power to force us to vote for one of two individuals whose loyalty is primarily to a Republican or Democrat party .\nThis limiting of political ideas has led to decades of policy failures . On the most important issues , the two major parties are identical . Both parties have contributed to our massive national debt ; tolerate the abuse of war powers by the president ; and ignore a haphazard health system costing twice as much an any industrialized nation but leaving 30 million people uninsured or underinsured . These are only a few of government \u2019 s failed policies .\nProfessor Brian Porto , in his law review \u201c The Constitution and the Ballot Box \u201d explains that while political parties organized a few years after the founding of our country , it was not until the 1912 elections , when Teddy Roosevelt \u2019 s Bull Moose party received more votes than the Republican , and the Socialist Party received six percent of the presidential vote and won several congressional seats , 79 mayoralties and over 1,200 local offices , that the two major parties feared they needed protection .\nAs fear gripped the Republican & Democratic parties ; state legislatures began making access to the ballot more difficult for third-party candidates than for Republican & Democratic candidates , by :\nRequiring a significant number of signatures , e.g . 3 % of the vote in the last Gubernatorial race , while waving or substantially reducing the number of signatures needed by Republican & Democratic candidates ;\nProviding shorter time periods for third-party candidates to gather signatures than for Republican & Democratic party candidates ;\nRequiring third-party presidential nominees to file nominating petitions 8 months before the election and months before the Republican & Democratic candidates had to file ;\nImposing signature distribution requirements on third-party candidates , e.g . a certain number of signatures from each county or congressional district ; and\nRequiring new third-parties to nominate candidates for each office up for election in that cycle .\nEach obstacle acted to limit political competition and to ensure perpetual control of government in the U.S. by the two major parties .\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates \u2013 the ultimate slap in democracy \u2019 s face\nAn October 11 , 2019 press release from the Commission on Presidential Debates ( \u201c CPD \u201d ) announcing its 2020 debate schedule , and a March , 2019 court opinion , provide a glimpse into who controls our government ?\nThe CPD , a private organization , operating under FEC regulations , has government authorization to set standards that prevent third-party candidates from participating in presidential debates . The CPD has this power as long it does not directly endorse , support , or oppose a candidate , and selects at least two debate candidates . Moreover , those with the most to gain from the major parties , corporations and media , can fund the debates with tax-deductible contributions .\nNotwithstanding assertions of \u201c impartiality , \u201d CPD officials wear many hats , e.g . CPD board member and Chair of a political party . These officials can also take positions contrary to CPD when speaking in their \u201c individual capacity. \u201d Such looseness of structure allows the CPD to satisfy FEC requirements while setting \u201c objective \u201d standards not achievable by third-parties .\nThis controversy started immediately after the major parties formed the CPD in 1987 . Prior to the CPD , The League of Women Voters ( \u201c The League \u201d ) , sponsored the debates . When The League discovered the two major political parties secretly gave the campaigns control over questioners , composition of audience , and press access , it withdrew its support .\nThe League president , Nancy Neuman , characterized these actions as \u201c campaign-trail charades devoid of substance\u2026that would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter . \u201d\nFrom the inception of the CPD , only one candidate , not a Republican or Democrat , was invited to debate , Ross Perot , in 1992 ; at the request of the other participants . His debate performance helpd him garner 18.91 % of the popular vote .\nBefore the 2000 election , the CPD amended its criteria to require participants to secure at least 15 % support in selected polls .

        "content_original": "The United States has 328 million people. We have some of the most educated and creative minds in the world. But in 2020, amid numerous crises, the two major political parties appear to be nominating for president, individuals so exceptionally flawed, that all one can ask is \u2013 can\u2019t we find someone better than these two?\n\nHas the U.S. transitioned into a Kakistocracy \u2013 rule by the least able or least principled citizens?\n\nThe Democrats are about to nominate a man referred to as \u201cSleepy Joe Biden.\u201d He is gaffe prone; decades of gaffes insulting blacks, Indians, women, disabled\u2014to name a few. He also has a lifetime of plagiarism starting with law school papers and continuing on to Senate floor speeches and presidential campaigns.\n\nThe Republicans are about to re-nominate a man described by behavioral scientists as a perfect example of a \u201c narcissist \u201c. A grandiose self-image. An inflated ego. A continuous need for attention. A big urge to be admired. And if that admiration is lacking or the narcissist is criticized (which is even worse), he lashes out recklessly.\n\nAmericans know the system does not work for them!\n\nOnly 1 in 10 adults believe the two-party system works. Gallup finds 57% of Americans say a new major political party is needed. The Pew Research Center report finds: \u201cPublic trust in the government remains near historic lows. Only 17% of Americans today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right \u201cjust about always\u201d (3%) or \u201cmost of the time\u201d (14%).\u201d\n\nA Real Clear average of polls for April 2020 finds only 35.1% of Americans believe the country is on the \u201cright-track\u201d whereas 57.7 % believe it is on the \u201cwrong-track.\u201d\n\nHow did two political parties limit political competition to such an extent that they secured complete control of the government of the United States?\n\nThe Republican and Democratic parties manipulate election laws to ensure one of their loyalists almost always wins the election. Controlling who wins directly translates into what laws are enacted, which citizens or corporations receive subsidies, who is taxed more or taxed less, how commerce is regulated and who will judge us should we violate any command.\n\nAccording to David Nir, in an article in the Daily Kos that references Becoming a Candidate, a book by Jennifer Lawless, there are 519,682 elected officeholders in the United States. Of this total the Libertarian Party, in 2017, claims 168 of these officeholders; the Green Party in 2016 held 143 offices, and the Constitution Party holds 12 offices. Many of these positions are non-partisan offices. There are also, at least 26 Independent office holders, including 2 U.S. Senators who caucus with the Democrats, and 26 Democratic Vermont Progressives. A basic calculation places the third-party competitors\u2019 share of the political market at 0.0007215%.\n\nWhat makes the power of the two major parties so baffling is that political parties are not mentioned in our Constitution. In fact, for the first several years of our Republic, there were no political parties.\n\nA political party is merely a corporation designed to take control of government\n\nPolitical parties are nothing more than highly organized, demographically diverse, nonprofit associations of individuals, arranged in a corporate structure, for the sole purpose of controlling all government in the United States and by extension, us. This duopoly, through its many affiliates, has officers in every nook and cranny in the nation to ensure that a member of one of two major parties occupies every seat in government.\n\nBeyond excluding citizens, with different political viewpoints, from participating in the governing of the nation, Republicans and Democrats turn representative government on its head. Instead of allowing citizens to vote for a person who will serve as a fiduciary loyal to the Constitution and citizens; the two major parties use their massive power to force us to vote for one of two individuals whose loyalty is primarily to a Republican or Democrat party.\n\nThis limiting of political ideas has led to decades of policy failures. On the most important issues, the two major parties are identical. Both parties have contributed to our massive national debt; tolerate the abuse of war powers by the president; and ignore a haphazard health system costing twice as much an any industrialized nation but leaving 30 million people uninsured or underinsured. These are only a few of government\u2019s failed policies.\n\nHow did we allow this to happen?\n\nProfessor Brian Porto, in his law review \u201cThe Constitution and the Ballot Box\u201d explains that while political parties organized a few years after the founding of our country, it was not until the 1912 elections, when Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s Bull Moose party received more votes than the Republican, and the Socialist Party received six percent of the presidential vote and won several congressional seats, 79 mayoralties and over 1,200 local offices, that the two major parties feared they needed protection.\n\nAs fear gripped the Republican & Democratic parties; state legislatures began making access to the ballot more difficult for third-party candidates than for Republican & Democratic candidates, by:\n\nRequiring a significant number of signatures, e.g. 3% of the vote in the last Gubernatorial race, while waving or substantially reducing the number of signatures needed by Republican & Democratic candidates;\n\nProviding shorter time periods for third-party candidates to gather signatures than for Republican & Democratic party candidates;\n\nRequiring third-party presidential nominees to file nominating petitions 8 months before the election and months before the Republican & Democratic candidates had to file;\n\nImposing signature distribution requirements on third-party candidates, e.g. a certain number of signatures from each county or congressional district; and\n\nRequiring new third-parties to nominate candidates for each office up for election in that cycle.\n\nEach obstacle acted to limit political competition and to ensure perpetual control of government in the U.S. by the two major parties.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates \u2013 the ultimate slap in democracy\u2019s face\n\nAn October 11, 2019 press release from the Commission on Presidential Debates (\u201cCPD\u201d) announcing its 2020 debate schedule, and a March, 2019 court opinion, provide a glimpse into who controls our government?\n\nThe CPD, a private organization, operating under FEC regulations, has government authorization to set standards that prevent third-party candidates from participating in presidential debates. The CPD has this power as long it does not directly endorse, support, or oppose a candidate, and selects at least two debate candidates. Moreover, those with the most to gain from the major parties, corporations and media, can fund the debates with tax-deductible contributions.\n\nNotwithstanding assertions of \u201cimpartiality,\u201d CPD officials wear many hats, e.g. CPD board member and Chair of a political party. These officials can also take positions contrary to CPD when speaking in their \u201cindividual capacity.\u201d Such looseness of structure allows the CPD to satisfy FEC requirements while setting \u201cobjective\u201d standards not achievable by third-parties.\n\nThis controversy started immediately after the major parties formed the CPD in 1987. Prior to the CPD, The League of Women Voters (\u201cThe League\u201d), sponsored the debates. When The League discovered the two major political parties secretly gave the campaigns control over questioners, composition of audience, and press access, it withdrew its support.\n\nThe League president, Nancy Neuman, characterized these actions as \u201ccampaign-trail charades devoid of substance\u2026that would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.\u201d\n\nFrom the inception of the CPD, only one candidate, not a Republican or Democrat, was invited to debate, Ross Perot, in 1992; at the request of the other participants. His debate performance helpd him garner 18.91% of the popular vote.\n\nBefore the 2000 election, the CPD amended its criteria to require participants to secure at least 15% support in selected polls. This requirement is rarely achieved by a third-party candidate, and is much higher than required for state ballot qualification or public financing. Ralph Nader, Green party candidate on the ballot in 43 states, was so angry, the CPD had to physically bar him from the debates.\n\nThe real action however, was in the courts. Level the Playing Field and Gary Johnson, Libertarian Party, litigated against the 15% poll criteria alleging FEC and CPD regulatory non-compliance and violations of First Amendment rights and the anti-trust laws. The FEC and the federal courts, in derogatory fashion, dismissed all complaints leaving the two major parties in complete control of the debates.\n\nAn appeals court noted: \u201cEvery four years, we suffer through the celebration of democracy (and national nightmare) that is a presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe trial court dismissed as \u201cold news\u201d statements by the Republican chair of the CPD, that the Commission \u201cwas not likely to look with favor on including third-party candidates in the debates\u201d and the Democratic chair saying he \u201cpersonally believed the panel should exclude third-party candidates from the debates.\u201d Also, the \u201cCPD director asserted CPD officials are \u201cpermitted to wear multiple hats and can speak freely \u2026 in [their] \u2026 personal capacity.\u201d\n\nThe two major parties rig the system, so they win! They have established a Kakistocracy. Who represents the citizens of the U.S.?\n\nThis article was first published in medium.com on May 4, 2020.

In recent days , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have demanded that the U.S. strategy for targeting the Islamic State be put to a vote on Capitol Hill , amid speculation the military campaign might expand into Syria .\nBut Obama stressed Thursday that `` we do n't have a strategy yet '' and pushed back on reports that , he said , suggest the country is about to go `` full scale on an elaborate strategy '' in the Middle East .\n`` The suggestion , I guess , has been that we 'll start moving forward imminently and somehow Congress , still out of town , is going to be left in the dark , '' he said . `` That 's not what 's going to happen .

Obama said he also spoke by phone Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .\nIn a written statement , though , Sens . John McCain , R-Ariz. , and Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , said Russia 's actions can only be described as a `` cross-border military invasion , '' adding : `` To claim it is anything other than that is to inhabit President Putin 's Orwellian universe . ''\nThey urged broader `` sectoral '' sanctions and U.S. and European military support for Ukraine .\n`` This is a moment to speak and act with clarity . A sovereign nation in the heart of Europe is being invaded by its larger neighbor , '' they said . `` If we will not or can not defend our own values now , as well as friends who share them , the future will be dark and dangerous indeed , not just for Ukraine but for us too . ''\nAt the end of Thursday 's remarks , Obama briefly addressed ongoing deliberations over possible executive action on immigration .\nRepublicans have voiced concern he 'll issue a mass reprieve in the coming weeks for illegal immigrants .\nObama did not indicate what he might decide but said : `` In the absence of congressional action , I 'm going to do what I can to make sure the system works better .

Amid speculation over whether the U.S. would ever partner with Bashar Assad to fight ISIS on that side of the border, Obama reiterated his view that \"Assad's lost legitimacy.\"\n\nHe said the U.S. would continue to support the \"moderate opposition\" in the country, giving people a choice other than just Assad or ISIS.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, after Obama's remarks, urged the president to develop a \"regional strategy\" for the Islamic State and present it to Congress and the American people.\n\n\"If the President is prepared to engage Congress with a strategic plan to protect the U.S. and our allies from ISIL, I believe he will have significant congressional support,\" he said. \"But don't forget, the threat from ISIL is real and it's growing -- and it is time for President Obama to exercise some leadership in launching a response.\"\n\nThe president's remarks also came amid increased tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Officials in Ukraine say two Russian military columns rolled into the southeastern part of the country after missiles were fired at a border post.\n\nObama on Thursday blamed Russia for the unrest, saying the country deliberately and repeatedly has violated Ukraine's sovereignty. He said Russia is training, arming and funding pro-Russian separatists in Russia.\n\nObama, though, said a \"military solution to this problem is not going to be forthcoming.\"\n\nRather, he said he wants to continue to mobilize the international community to bring pressure on Russia. \"This ongoing Russian incursion into Ukraine will only bring more costs and consequences for Russia,\" Obama said.\n\nObama said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko will visit the White House next month, in what would be his first visit since becoming president. Obama said he also spoke by phone Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nIn a written statement, though, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Russia's actions can only be described as a \"cross-border military invasion,\" adding: \"To claim it is anything other than that is to inhabit President Putin's Orwellian universe.\"\n\nThey urged broader \"sectoral\" sanctions and U.S. and European military support for Ukraine.\n\n\"This is a moment to speak and act with clarity. A sovereign nation in the heart of Europe is being invaded by its larger neighbor,\" they said. \"If we will not or cannot defend our own values now, as well as friends who share them, the future will be dark and dangerous indeed, not just for Ukraine but for us too.\"\n\nAt the end of Thursday's remarks, Obama briefly addressed ongoing deliberations over possible executive action on immigration.\n\nRepublicans have voiced concern he'll issue a mass reprieve in the coming weeks for illegal immigrants.\n\nObama did not indicate what he might decide but said: \"In the absence of congressional action, I'm going to do what I can to make sure the system works better.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Infringing upon it without procedural due process is always constitutionally impermissible.\n\nThe Constitution was not written for the government to right every wrong.\n\nWe know that government itself causes most wrongs \u2014 the theft of property by taxation, the impairment of economic liberty by regulation, the slaughter of innocents by war, the infringement of expressive liberties by majority vote. Yet, the Constitution still mandates an exacting due process for all whom the government would restrain.\n\nThat means a trial before any quarantine, no matter the public danger, and a fair trial, not one animated by mass hysteria or government-generated fear.\n\nJudge Andrew P. Napolitano was the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in the history of New Jersey. He is Fox News\u2019 senior judicial analyst.

Well, the soft senior men and women running those organizations are finding out, as the young wokes in their newsrooms take over because the old guard is too exhausted to resist.\n\nOur scientists offer scientific findings that inevitably support the liberal narrative. The new scientific method is determining what\u2019s woke and half-heartedly working backwards from there. So, one day we\u2019ll all die if we let our kids play in the park, then the next we hear we\u2019re immune to the pangolin pandemic if our hearts are woke enough. To point out that this is idiocy is to deny science.\n\nIn Hollywood, the studios rush to hide what used to be merely bad taste but is now heresy. And our courageous comedians cower, terrified to mock the eminently mockable antics of Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the other sects of the left\u2019s semi-organized religion. But hey, those Audie Murphys of America\u2019s stages and screens will never hesitate to take on those Jesus-loving Christians.\n\nCorporations and enterprises like the NFL and NASCAR abandon and spit on their own customers, treating them as racist rubes as the C-suite sissies seek to please their younger second wives and not the people who buy their stuff. You can\u2019t open an email without being reminded that the company that makes your fertilizer is giving part of the cash you spend with it to the Marxist cadre at Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn people\u2019s private lives, tiresome acquaintances scold others on social media for failing to post the right nonsense on their Facebook pages. Daughters rebel against whatever it is suburban daughters have to rebel against by announcing on Twitter that they are cutting off their parents because their parents are insufficiently woke (though whether that lasts past daddy cutting off young Ashleigh\u2019s cash remains to be seen). Frigid suburban matrons cruise into their local Starbucks, book cover facing out so everyone knows that they are carrying a copy of White Fragility. It\u2019s the new 50 Shade of Gray, with the same vibe of cringey masochism that helps fill up with their empty lives and lets them feel something, anything. There\u2019s a reason that these people all seem to have weird issues and to be working them out on the rest of us. These people all have weird issues and are working them out on the rest of us.\n\nAnd it is all based on a lie, just like everything liberals say about Donald Trump and you is a lie.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to purge our society of systemic racism because heroes in the past did that for us. From the heroes of Gettysburg to heroes like Medgar Evers (an Army vet of Normandy appropriately buried in Arlington), the blood of patriots washed away the structural racism of the past. What is left today are a few idiots with tiki torches and lots of college professors and New York Times scribblers who thrive upon hating people for where their great-great-great-great grandfathers came from. Those garbage people are the exception, a fringe, and do not reflect America\n\nSadly, structural liberalism is beginning to. Liberals want an America of terrified conformity, of eternal grievance and hate, where the rights of individuals are crushed if they prove to be an obstacle to liberal rule.\n\nWho wants to punish people for their speech? Liberals.\n\nWho wants to discriminate among people based on their race? Liberals.\n\nAnd who wants this hate to continue and even grow because they see harnessing it as their means to take perpetual power? Liberals.\n\nIt\u2019s past time to smash systemic liberalism. Get ready to be the backlash.\n\nFight the lies. Join Townhall VIP. Also, my new non-fiction book from Regnery, The 21 Biggest Lies about Donald Trump (and You!) drops July 7, and you should pre-order it right now! And don\u2019t forget my novels eerily prescient novels of America torn apart by leftists, People's Republic, Indian Country, Wildfire and Collapse!",

It is the fidelity to the rule of law of the FBI .\nThe recent revelations of the receipt by Clinton of a Special Access Program email , as well as cut and pasted summaries of state secrets on her server and on her BlackBerry nearly guarantee that the FBI will recommend that the Department of Justice convene a grand jury and seek her indictment for espionage . Here is the backstory .\nIt seems that every week , more information comes to light about Clinton \u2019 s grave legal woes . Her worries are in two broad categories : One is her well-documented failure to safeguard state secrets and the other is her probable use of her position as secretary of state to advance financially her husband \u2019 s charitable foundation . The FBI is currently and aggressively investigating both . What I will describe below is in the state secrets category . It is apparently not new to the FBI , but it is new to the public .\nAmong the data that the FBI either found on the Clinton server or acquired from the State Department via its responses to Freedom of Information Act requests is a top-secret email that has been denominated Special Access Program . Top secret is the highest category of state secrets ( the other categories are confidential and secret ) , and of the sub-parts of top secret , SAP is the most sensitive .\nSAP is clothed in such secrecy that it can not be received or opened accidentally . Clinton -- who ensured all of her governmental emails came to her through her husband \u2019 s server , a nonsecure nongovernmental venue -- could only have received or viewed it from that server after inputting certain codes . Those codes change at unscheduled times , such that she would need to inquire of them before inputting them .\nThe presence of the SAP-denominated email on her husband \u2019 s server , whether opened or not , shows a criminal indifference to her lawful obligation to maintain safely all state secrets entrusted to her care . Yet , Clinton has suggested that she is hopelessly digitally inept and may not have known what she was doing . This constitutes an attempted plausible deniability to the charge of failing to safeguard state secrets .\nBut in this sensitive area of the law , plausible deniability is not an available defense ; no judge would permit the assertion of it in legal filings or in a courtroom , and no lawyer would permit a client to make the assertion .\nThis is so for two reasons . First , failure to safeguard state secrets is a crime for which the government need not prove intent . The failure can be done negligently . Thus , plausible deniability is actually an admission of negligence and , hence in this case , an admission of guilt , not a denial .\nSecond , Clinton signed an oath under penalty of perjury on Jan. 22 , 2009 , her first full day as secretary of state . In that oath , she acknowledged that she had received a full FBI briefing on the lawfully required care and keeping of state secrets . Her briefing and her oath specified that the obligation to safeguard state secrets is absolute -- it can not be avoided or evaded by forgetfulness or any other form of negligence , and that negligence can bring prosecution .\nWhat type of data is typically protected by the SAP denomination ? The most sensitive under the sun -- such as the names of moles ( spies working for more than one government ) and their American handlers , the existence of black ops ( illegal programs that the U.S. government carries out , of which it will deny knowledge if exposed ) , codes needed to access state secrets and ongoing intelligence gathering projects .\nThe crime here occurs when SAPs are exposed by residing in a nonsecure venue ; it does not matter for prosecution purposes whether they fell into the wrong hands .\nClinton \u2019 s persistent mocking of the seriousness of all this is the moral equivalent of taunting alligators before crossing a stream . SAPs are so sensitive that most of the FBI agents who are investigating Clinton lack the security clearances needed to view the SAP found among her emails . Most FBI agents have never seen a SAP .\nShortly after the presence of the SAP-denominated email was made known , the State Department released another email Clinton failed to erase wherein she instructed her subordinates to take state secrets from a secure venue , to cut and paste and summarize them , and send them to her on her nonsecure venue . Such an endeavor , if carried out , is a felony -- masking and then not safeguarding state secrets . Such a command to subordinates can only come from a criminal mind .\nEqually as telling is a little-known 2013 speech that recently surfaced given by one of Clinton \u2019 s former subordinates . The aide revealed that Clinton and her staff regularly engaged in digital conversations about state secrets on their BlackBerries . This is not criminal if the BlackBerries were government-issued and secured . Clinton \u2019 s was neither . It was purchased at her instructions off the shelf by one of her staff .\nCan anyone doubt that Clinton has failed to safeguard state secrets ? If her name were Hillary Rodham instead of Hillary Rodham Clinton , she \u2019 d have been indicted months ago .\nWhat remains of the rule of law in America ? The FBI will soon tell us .",

In that oath, she acknowledged that she had received a full FBI briefing on the lawfully required care and keeping of state secrets. Her briefing and her oath specified that the obligation to safeguard state secrets is absolute -- it cannot be avoided or evaded by forgetfulness or any other form of negligence, and that negligence can bring prosecution.\n\nWhat type of data is typically protected by the SAP denomination? The most sensitive under the sun -- such as the names of moles (spies working for more than one government) and their American handlers, the existence of black ops (illegal programs that the U.S. government carries out, of which it will deny knowledge if exposed), codes needed to access state secrets and ongoing intelligence gathering projects.\n\nThe crime here occurs when SAPs are exposed by residing in a nonsecure venue; it does not matter for prosecution purposes whether they fell into the wrong hands.\n\nClinton\u2019s persistent mocking of the seriousness of all this is the moral equivalent of taunting alligators before crossing a stream. SAPs are so sensitive that most of the FBI agents who are investigating Clinton lack the security clearances needed to view the SAP found among her emails. Most FBI agents have never seen a SAP.\n\nShortly after the presence of the SAP-denominated email was made known, the State Department released another email Clinton failed to erase wherein she instructed her subordinates to take state secrets from a secure venue, to cut and paste and summarize them, and send them to her on her nonsecure venue. Such an endeavor, if carried out, is a felony -- masking and then not safeguarding state secrets. Such a command to subordinates can only come from a criminal mind.\n\nEqually as telling is a little-known 2013 speech that recently surfaced given by one of Clinton\u2019s former subordinates. The aide revealed that Clinton and her staff regularly engaged in digital conversations about state secrets on their BlackBerries. This is not criminal if the BlackBerries were government-issued and secured. Clinton\u2019s was neither. It was purchased at her instructions off the shelf by one of her staff.\n\nCan anyone doubt that Clinton has failed to safeguard state secrets? If her name were Hillary Rodham instead of Hillary Rodham Clinton, she\u2019d have been indicted months ago.\n\nWhat remains of the rule of law in America? The FBI will soon tell us.",
